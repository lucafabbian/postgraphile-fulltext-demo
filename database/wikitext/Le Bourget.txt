Le Bourget (French pronunciation: [lə buʁ'ʒɛ] (listen)) is a commune in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, France. It is located 10.6 km (6+9⁄16 mi) from the center of Paris.
The commune features Le Bourget Airport, which in turn hosts the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace (Air and Space Museum). A very small part of Le Bourget Airport lies on the territory of the commune of Le Bourget, which nonetheless gave its name to the airport. Most of the airport lies on the territory of the communes of Dugny, Bonneuil-en-France, and Gonesse. The Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile is also headquartered on the airport grounds and in Le Bourget proper.

He was welcomed as the "victor" of the North Atlantic, posing on his Spirit of St. Louis. An enormous crowd also welcomed Edouard Daladier on September 29, 1938, after the signing of the Munich Agreement signed between Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Italy represented respectively by Adolf Hitler, Edouard Daladier, Neville Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini (who had acted as intermediary).
