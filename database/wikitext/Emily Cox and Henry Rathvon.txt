Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon are a married American puzzle-writing team. They wrote the "Atlantic Puzzler", a monthly cryptic crossword in  The Atlantic magazine, from September 1977 to October 2009; it was published online-only beginning March 2006. They also create acrostics and cryptic crosswords for the New York Times, cryptics for Canada's National Post, puzzles for the US Airways in-flight magazine, and (with Henry Hook) Sunday crosswords for the Boston Globe.
Often published under the pseudonym Hex, Cox and Rathvon are considered pioneers of the American cryptic crossword and remain among the form's greatest exponents.
