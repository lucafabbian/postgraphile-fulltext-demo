Alan Davies: As Yet Untitled  is a British television programme that was first broadcast on Dave and hosted by comedian Alan Davies. In each episode Davies holds an unscripted roundtable discussion with four guests. The guests include stand-up comedians, comedy writers and other well-known figures in the entertainment industry. Each episode begins untitled, hence the series name, but a title is chosen at the conclusion of the episode, often a full or paraphrased quote from one of the guest's anecdotes.
As Yet Untitled, recorded in Riverside Studios, began airing with a five-episode series plus a compilation episode in June 2014. The show returned in January 2015, recorded in The Hospital Club, for a ten-part second series with another compilation episode. A third series containing ten episodes began in November 2015, alongside both a compilation episode and Christmas special. The fourth series of ten episodes aired in June 2016. The fifth series, lasting eight episodes, started in February 2017. The sixth series of ten episodes was recorded in The Roundhouse and aired from July 2021. After another brief break, a seventh series was recorded late in 2022 in the Grand Hall at the Battersea Arts Centre, and started airing in March 2023.
