Karl Marx: His Life and Environment is a 1939 biography of the philosopher Karl Marx by the historian of ideas Isaiah Berlin.
In a 1995 interview with Michael Ignatieff, first broadcast on BBC Two in November 1997, after his death, Berlin described how he came to write the book:When I was first asked to do it…I read far more Marx that will ever be good for anyone else to read again…. He was pompous, heavy, highly intelligent, made heavy German jokes, quite good, rather a bully, of a rather impressive kind. You felt you were in the presence of an intellectually powerful figure who wanted to dictate to one, didn’t terribly want to know what one thought, wanted you to know what he thought.
The book charts the chief phases of Marx’ life, and renders his ideas ‘with a sympathetic grasp both of it subject’s motives and his limitations’.


== Reception ==
The historian Peter Gay wrote that Karl Marx: His Life and Environment is one of the best discussions of alienation in the literature on Marx and Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and among such accounts, distinguished by its lucidity. Berlin's style of writing has been praised by the political scientist David McLellan, and the philosopher John Gray.
