Cabinteely (Irish: CLG Chábán tSíle) is a Dublin GAA club based in Kilbogget Park which serves the Cabinteely / Johnstown / Killiney / Cherrywood / Ballybrack / Loughlinstown areas of Dublin, Ireland.


== History ==
Cabinteely GAA Club was founded in 1977 and shortly thereafter acquired home grounds at the newly developed Kilbogget Park, Cabinteely.
The clubhouse at Kilbogget Park was opened in 1994 by which stage the club fielded juvenile teams, 2 adult football teams as well as an adult hurling team - Kerry GAA legends Eoin 'Bomber' Liston and Ogie Moran guested for the club in the exhibition game held on the day to honour the occasion.  
In the late 1990s, the club fielded its first girls' football teams and this would later lead to the formation of Foxrock Cabinteely.
Cabinteely won two Dublin Junior Hurling Championships in the 1990s, in 1995 and in 1997. Both finals were against St Finian's (Swords).
