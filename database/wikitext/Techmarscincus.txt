Techmarscincus is a genus of skink, a lizard in the family Scincidae. The genus is endemic to Australia, and is monotypic, containing the sole species Techmarscincus jigurru.
Techmarscincus jigurru, commonly known as the Bartle Frere skink, is a species of rare and endangered lizard first discovered in 1981. It was described and named in 1984 by the late Australian herpetologist Jeanette Covacevich.


== Geographic range ==
The Bartle Frere skink is endemic to Queensland, Australia. 


== Description ==
T. jigurru has a rainbow sheen color. Its body is long and flat, with short limbs and a long tail.


== Behaviour ==
The Bartle Frere skink is agile and energetic. It is only seen out and basking during the day. It spends most of its time on top of exposed granite boulders.  A night, it retreats into cracks in the exposed granite. The Bartle Frere skink tolerates juveniles in the same area, as most skinks do not.


== Habitat ==
The Bartle Frere skink is usually found above 1,400 m (4,600 ft) on the slopes of Queensland's highest mountains (e.g., Mount Bartle Frere). The climate is of a temperate rain forest.


== Reproduction ==
T. jigurru is oviparous.
