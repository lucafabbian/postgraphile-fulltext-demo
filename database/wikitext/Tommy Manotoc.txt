== PBA career ==


=== As head coach ===
Manotoc began his coaching career in 1977 with the U/Tex Wranglers in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA).  He was the Wranglers' team manager at the time when head coach Narciso Bernardo suddenly resigned after the 1977 All-Filipino Conference. Manotoc made his coaching debut during the 1977 Open Conference and immediately brought the Wranglers to a runner-up finish against Crispa, in the franchise's first finals appearance.  Manotoc gave the Wranglers two PBA Open Conference championships, in 1978 and in 1980. He admitted that besting Toyota in 1980, felt like an achievement since they were down by four points with 16 seconds remaining in the fourth, but ultimately forced overtime and won.Manotoc joined San Miguel Beer in 1981 and led the team to one PBA championship.
Manotoc joined the Crispa Redmanizers in 1983 and piloted the franchise to its second grand slam during the same season. On July 1, 1984, citing health reasons, Manotoc resigned as head coach after leading the Redmanizers to the 1984 PBA First All-Filipino Conference finals, winning over NCC, 96–94. He was to be succeeded by assistant coach Narciso Bernardo, who finished the task of capturing the title against the Gilbey's Gin Tonics.
After a long hiatus from coaching, Manotoc made a brief return to the PBA — in 1992 for the Presto Ice Cream Kings — and in 1997–1998 for the Mobiline Phone Pals.
A few decades later in June 2020, he revealed that during his championship stints as head coach of both U-Tex and Crispa, he did not charge the team, in terms of salary, and his bonuses that he had earned, were instead given to his father.
