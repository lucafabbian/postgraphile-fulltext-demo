No Kiseki, or Super Session (released in 1969) is the second album by the Japanese psychedelic band The Jacks. After the groups more acclaimed work Vacant World, Super Session went in a new direction, more tailored to the 1960s Japanese pop scene. Though internationally obscure, the release is still in print by Toshiba/EMI Japan.
