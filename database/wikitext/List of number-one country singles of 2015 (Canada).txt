Canada Country is a chart published weekly by Billboard magazine.This 50-position chart lists the most popular country music songs, calculated weekly by airplay on 31 country music stations across the country as monitored by Nielsen BDS. Songs are ranked by total plays. As with most other Billboard charts, the Canada Country chart features a rule for when a song enters recurrent rotation. A song is declared recurrent if it has been on the chart longer than 30 weeks and is lower than number 20 in rank.These are the Canadian number-one country singles of 2015, per the BDS Canada Country Airplay chart.
Note that Billboard publishes charts with an issue date approximately 7â€“10 days in advance. And that "Lose My Mind" by Brett Eldredge which attained a weekly chart position of number-two also attained the number-one spot on the year-end chart.
