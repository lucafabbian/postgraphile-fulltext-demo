Trewithen House, near Grampound was purchased in 1715 for £2,700 by Philip Hawkins, presumably Hawkins' father as Hawkins himself was under age, but it became his residence and improvements were made to the house in 1723. Hawkins was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament for Grampound at the 1727 British general election. He was returned again unopposed at the 1734 British general election. He voted against the Administration on every recorded occasion.Hawkins died without issue at Truro on 6 September 1738, leaving Trewithen to his nephew Thomas Hawkins. He also bequeathed '£600 to his Majesty in lieu of his tenants having defrauded the Crown of about that sum in the customs'. His brother John was Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge between 1728 and 1733.
