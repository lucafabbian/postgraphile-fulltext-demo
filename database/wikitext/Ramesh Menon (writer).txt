== Biography ==
Born in New Delhi, Menon studied at St Xavier's High School and St Stephen's College, where he read History Honours (1968–69) and then Philosophy Honours (1969–70), but left college without taking a degree. Reading the Bhagavad-Gita at this time was a life-changing experience for him. It was the seed from which all his later work emerged.
He developed an informal guru-sishya relationship with the great Malayalam novelist OV Vijayan, and translated two of his master's novels into English: The Infinity of Grace (Penguin) and Madhuram Gayathi (yet to be published by Vijayan's estate after his demise in 2005).
Menon has lived and worked in Delhi, Hong Kong, Bengaluru, Jakarta, Tiruvananthapuram, Kodaikanal and Chennai.
