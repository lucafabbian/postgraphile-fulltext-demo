The title Baron Butler was created in the Peerage of England in 1666.
The Butler family have several branches (Irish: Buitléar) who descended from Irish-Norman dynasties, all of which descended from Theobald Walter who was Chief Butler of England.


== History of the title ==
Baron Butler of Moore Park, Co. Hertford, was created in the Peerage of England in 1666, for Thomas Butler, 6th Earl of Ossory (the eldest son of the 1st Duke of Ormonde). Four years previously, he had been called up to the Irish House of Lords by a writ of acceleration as the Earl of Ossory. As the Baron predeceased his father, his son James inherited the barony in 1680 and then the dukedom in 1688. However, in 1715 his English titles were attainted because of his part in the Jacobite rising. The title was able to pass through the female line and in 1871, the attainder was reversed for the great-great-great-great-grand-nephew of the second duke, the 7th Earl Cowper. Lord Cowper died childless, however, and the title has been abeyant since 1905.
