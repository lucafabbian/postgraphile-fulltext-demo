== History ==
The Academy was established in 1938 as a learned society.  When Estonia was occupied by the Soviet Union the Academy was dissolved on July 17, 1940.  In June 1945 it was reestablished as the Academy of Sciences of the Estonian SSR (Estonian: Eesti NSV Teaduste Akadeemia).  In Soviet times, it consisted of a central library and four divisions containing 15 research institutes as well as other scientific societies and museums. In April 1989, shortly before Estonian independence, the academy regained its original name of Estonian Academy of Sciences.  At this time it was also restructured into its present form.
