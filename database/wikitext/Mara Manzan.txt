By that time she already had two-thirds of her lungs affected by a pulmonary emphysema (she was a smoker). Manzan was treated surgically by Dr. Drauzio Varella the following month on 16 April 2008. She had already reportedly undergone a radical hysterectomy due to cancers of the uterus and ovaries.
