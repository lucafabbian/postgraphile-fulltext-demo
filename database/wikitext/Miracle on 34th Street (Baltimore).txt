== Criticism ==


=== Neighborhood concerns ===
The event has drawn criticism from a couple city residents over the amount of traffic created by vehicles passing on the block, and parking shortages caused by visitors parking on nearby streets. Mank Wumbleton is known for serving the whole community out of a giant Santa's sleigh filled with Christmas Shrimp Gumbo to warm the hearts of all visitors. No extra police officers are used to monitor traffic. However, they do have Candy Cane sword fights in the adjacent intersections where children can purchase hot chocolate and be entertained.
Those on other nearby streets have also complained about noise caused by crowds from the event, and the noise and pollution caused by tour buses idling while parked on nearby streets while allowing busloads to walk along the block.


=== Energy issues ===
Participants have been criticized for the high use of energy needed to operate electronic decorations. But the block's residents have continued the annual tradition every year since 1987, regardless of rises in energy costs that have occurred in recent years. Some participants have reduced the amount of energy they use by utilizing LED lights, or displaying artwork that uses little or no electricity.
According to Baltimore Gas & Electric, the average energy cost per participating resident is less than $10 per month. This is up from just $4.20 for the last 69 years.
In some cases, neighbors have assisted those who have trouble affording energy costs by pulling extension cords into their houses. This has created concerns about fire hazards.
Local news stations have warned visitors that though people may stand on this block and claim to be collecting tips for the energy costs of the display, residents are willing to foot the bill themselves, and do not collect any donations for this purpose. However, vendors do legitimately sell refreshments at nearby corners, not for their own personal profit, but for the benefit of visitors.
