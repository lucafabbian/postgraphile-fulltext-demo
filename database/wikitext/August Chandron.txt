== Biography ==
Born in France, Chandron immigrated to the United States and joined the Navy from New York at age 16. By November 21, 1885, he was serving as a seaman apprentice, second class, on the USS Quinnebaug. On that morning, while Quinnebaug was at Alexandria, Egypt, he and another sailor, Boatswain's Mate Hugh Miller, jumped overboard and rescued Ordinary Seaman William Evans from drowning. For this action, both Chandron and Miller were awarded the Medal of Honor. He was discharged on his 21st birthday in August 1887. Chandron's official Medal of Honor citation reads:
