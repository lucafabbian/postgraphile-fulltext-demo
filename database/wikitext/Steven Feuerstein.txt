Steven Feuerstein is an author focusing  on the Oracle database PL/SQL language, having written ten books on PL/SQL, and one book on mySQL, all published by O'Reilly Media. His signature book, Oracle PL/SQL Programming,
which many consider the "bible" for PL/SQL developers, was first published in September 1993. It has grown from 916 pages in 1993 to over 1000 pages in its 6th edition, published 20 years later.


== Career ==
Feuerstein has developed software since 1980. He spent five years with Oracle Corporation (1987â€“1992) and served as PL/SQL evangelist for Quest Software from January 2001 to 2013. In March 2014, he re-joined Oracle Corporation as an Architect and leads a team of Oracle Developer Advocates.
Between 1999 and 2008, he focused his attention on improving the testing of PL/SQL programs, first by starting the open-source framework utPLSQL for unit testing PL/SQL, later on through the creation of Quest Code Tester for Oracle, which automates PL/SQL code testing.
Steven was one of the original Oracle ACE Directors and publishes regularly in Oracle Magazine and in the ODTUG magazine.
In April 2010, Feuerstein launched the PL/SQL Challenge, a daily quiz on Oracle PL/SQL that quickly attracted over 1,000 daily players, making it one of the most active PL/SQL-related websites on the Internet. In 2011, Feuerstein added the PL/SQL Channel, which offers video-based training on the Oracle PL/SQL language.
In March 2014, Feuerstein re-joined Oracle Corporation as an evangelist. He then formed the Developer Advocates team to help Oracle Database users take full advantage of this database to build their applications. The PL/SQL Challenge was transformed into the Oracle Dev Gym, which offers quizzes, workouts and classes on SQL, PL/SQL, and other Oracle technologies.
