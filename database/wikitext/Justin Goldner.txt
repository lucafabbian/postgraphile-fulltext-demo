Justin Goldner is an American music producer, songwriter, arranger and session musician based in New York City, originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.His performances have been featured on Grammy, Latin Grammy and Tony award-winning projects (Dear Evan Hansen), as well as the Golden Globe winning film The Greatest Showman. He is a frequent contributor to projects by composers Pasek and Paul and Jason Robert Brown, including the latter’s Broadway musical The Bridges of Madison County.Goldner has been recognized for his mandolin performances with Sting at Carnegie Hall and live on NBC’s Christmas at Rockefeller Center, as well as his live performance with Ben Platt on the 60th Annual Grammy Awards telecast from Madison Square Garden. He also appears in Platt's Live from Radio City Music Hall concert special on Netflix.
As a music producer and songwriter, Goldner is known for drawing upon both acoustic and electronic textures. Since 2009, his work as producer and bandleader of Grace McLean & Them Apples has yielded two albums, combining McLean’s vocal looping techniques with organic instruments. Consecutive performances at Lincoln Center’s American Songbook Series in 2015 and 2016 garnered recognition in the New York Times, in which Stephen Holden wrote: “In the tradition of Bobby McFerrin, [Grace McLean] is also a sonic wizard who multiplies her voice in electronic loops that can turn a singer into a one-person chorus and rhythm section. […] The electronics wove in and out of polyrhythmic jazz and swing arrangements conceived mostly by Justin Goldner, her musical director and bassist.”
Goldner participated in developing the music for Pasek and Paul’s films The Greatest Showman, Spirited, and Lyle, Lyle Crocodile, as well as their musical Dear Evan Hansen, which he ultimately performed on Broadway and in the 2021 film adaptation. He has been featured in other performances with Ricky Martin, Macy Gray, Tori Kelly, Donald Glover, Shawn Mendes, Ledisi, Bruce Springsteen, James Taylor, Idina Menzel, Jordin Sparks, Ludwig Goransson, Ariana DeBose, Matisyahu, Amanda Brown, Steve Martin, John Turturro, Allison Williams, Jane Monheit, Jesse McCartney, Emily Kinney, Audra McDonald, Jeremy Jordan, Cynthia Erivo, Lolo, Grace Weber, Elle Varner, and his mentor, Meshell Ndegeocello.Other notable production and songwriting releases have included folk-pop trio Saint Adeline's eponymous debut album, Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio's Bubble Boy, and "Destiny", included on Hasbro's Jem & The Holograms tribute album. Goldner has also performed classically with the Chelsea Symphony and Teatro Graticello, and performed live electronics and sound design with new acoustic crossover group 9 Horses. He is known as well for collaborations with global artists, including Bollywood composers Shankar Mahadevan and Vishal Bhardwaj, Latin Grammy-winning Venezuelan vocalist/trumpeter Linda Briceño and Cuban rock band Del Exilio.
