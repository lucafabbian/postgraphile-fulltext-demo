It was designed by Sachindra Prasad Bose and Hemchandra Kanungo and unfurled on 7 August 1906 at Parsi Bagan Square (Girish Park), Calcutta.The flag had three horizontal bands of equal width with the top being orange, the centre yellow and the bottom green in colour. It had eight half-opened lotus flowers on the top stripe representing the eight provinces of British India and a picture of the sun and an Islamic-style crescent moon on the bottom stripe. वन्देमातरम् (Vande Mataram, meaning "Mother, I bow to thee!") was inscribed in the centre in Devanagari.
