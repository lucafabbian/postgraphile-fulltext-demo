=== Inventions ===
filter for gases: to be placed on the exhaust pipe of one's car to prevent CO2 emissions
a rocket to modify the weather: rocket full of explosive, but inefficient
quick floor polisher: consists of an old fire extinguisher.
table : a table camping which can fold automatically, thank to a small button situated at the center of the table, which can cause some unexpected and accidents
