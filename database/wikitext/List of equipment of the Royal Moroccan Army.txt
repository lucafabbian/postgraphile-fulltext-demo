=== Anti-tank weapons ===
The Royal Moroccan Army employs a variety of anti-tank weapons, ranging from disposable, man-portable rockets to armored tank destroyers equipped with guided missiles.
Portable anti-tank rockets are employed by the infantry.  Recoilless rifles are still in use, often mounted on trucks or other military vehicles, but they are being replaced by more effective anti-tank guided missiles.  Tank destroyers represent the most mobile and best protected anti-tank weapons in service.  Older gun-armed vehicles are being replaced by missile-equipped vehicles.  Several of the army's infantry fighting vehicles are likewise equipped with anti-tank missiles, adding to the anti-tank weaponry available in the field.


== Vehicles ==


=== Utility vehicles ===
The RMA's high-mobility multipurpose vehicles serves as cargo/troop carrier, weapons platform, and ambulance, among many other roles. 4000 HMMWV in different versions, 1,200 URO VAMTACs and 800 URO VAM-TL are part of RMAs inventory, which also includes various CUCVs. 378 GM Defense CUCVs (138 M1008, 188 M1009 and 52 M1028) and 278 M151s were received, and an unknown number of Santana Motor's Land Rover Model 88/106, Toyota FJ40, Jeep Auverland and Nissan Patrol ML-6 are also in service. An unknown number of ACMAT ALTV have also been purchased.Military logistics' missions are the storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of materiel, the transport of personnel, the acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation, and disposition of facilities, the acquisition or furnishing of services and Medical and health service support. It is the most important part and considered the base for the main mission of the RMA. Because of its topography and extensive range of action, the transport and resupply of troops posted in the Wall and East Frontier, where aerial transport is impossible or counterproductive, the use of land transport is primordial. The amount of active equipment is unknown, but estimations are possible. The number of medium and heavy trucks, HETs and Palletized Load Systems (PLS) purchased or in service were 250 IVECO M3-21.14 TT, ~3500 M35 and Variants, 387 M54 and variants, ~1,000 M800 series, 195 M816 Wrecker, ~160 M900 series, ~1000 TRM10000/9000 BMH and 600 ACMAT VLRA. An unknown number of Pegaso 3055, Mercedes-Benz Actros and Unimog are also in RMA's inventory. The Heavy Equipment Transport Systems (HETS) received were an unknown number of M746, 6 M747, 23 M1070, 133 M911 HETS and 100 IVECO TRACTOR. Two M1075 & M1076 Palletized load systems were also purchased.
Armoured recovery vehicles (ARV) are used to repair damaged as well as broken-down armoured vehicles during combat, or to tow them out of the danger zone for more extensive repairs. For this mission 86 M578, 10 SK-105 ARV, 4 VT1A ARV and 81 M88 Recovery Vehicles were acquired.

== Air defense systems ==
After years of negligence of its air defense capabilities Morocco shifted its air defense strategy, investing heavily in new air defense bases and systems.Morocco has been slowly building a multi-layered air defense system consisting of HIMAD and SHORAD systems in order to give Moroccan air space maximum protection.Moroccan air defense system consists of the newly acquired advanced long range Chinese HIMAD systems the FD-2000B with a maximum range of 250 km range ,the chinese SKY DRAGON 50 with a maximum range of 50 km, the Barak 8 MX with multiple layers of coverage (35-150 km) , and the american Patriot PAC-3 MSE with a range of 60 km against ballistic missiles
The man-portable air-defense systems used by the infantry are the 9K32 "Strela-2" (SA-7 Grail), 9K38 "Igla" (SA-18 Grouse).
Other systems include AAG as M1939 (61-K), ZU-23-2 or M167 VADS, usually mounted on LUVs and CUCVs.
