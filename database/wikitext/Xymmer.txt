Xymmer is a genus of ant in the subfamily Amblyoponinae containing the single species Xymmer muticus.


== Taxonomy ==
Xymmer was first described by Santschi (1914) as a monotypic subgeneric taxon under Stigmatomma. Since Santschi's original description, Xymmer was raised to genus by Wheeler (1922) in his identification key for African Amblyoponini. Clark (1934) regarded Xymmer as a subgenus in Amblyopone following Wheeler's suggestion; however, distinguishing characters were not discussed in their treatments. Brown (1949, 1960) discussed separable characters for Xymmer (as a junior synonym under the subgenus Stigmatomma) for the first time since Santschi's original description. Brown regarded Stigmatomma and its related names as junior synonyms of Amblyopone at that time. Xymmer was resurrected to its current placement as an independent genus from synonymy with Amblyopone based on a morphological examination by Yoshimura & Fisher (2012).
