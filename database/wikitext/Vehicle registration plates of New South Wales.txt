== Previous general series ==
Cars and Heavy Vehicles

1910–1924: nnn•nnn (cars only)
1910–1937: L·nn•nnn (lorries only)
1924–1937: nnn•nnn (cars only)
1937–1951: aa•nnn (cars and lorries)
1951–1961: aaa•nnn
1961–2004: aaa•nnn
From 1910 to 1937, serials on registration plates for cars were all-numeric, running from 1 to 274-000, while serials on plates for lorries consisted of the letter L followed by up to five numbers. All plates from 1910 to 1924 consisted of black characters on a white background, with the state abbreviation added in 1912. In 1924, the colour scheme for car plates was reversed, so that they consisted of white characters on a black background. Rear plates are supplied by the government and motorists have to request front plates to be made.
From February 1936, a new all numeric standard Australian style embossed plates were introduced to replace various styles that lasted until May 1937. the embossed style continues to the current series. Both sets are issued forward, removing the need for motorists to have front plates made themselves.
On 16 April 1937, a new serial format was adopted for both cars and lorries, consisting of two letters followed by three numbers, with leading zeros as necessary. This ran from AA-000 to ZZ-999, with the letters I and Q omitted to avoid confusion with the numbers 1 and 0 and the letter O. Plates for both vehicle types consisted of white characters on a black background.
When the two-letter serials were exhausted on 3 May 1951, a three-letter format was introduced, starting at AAA-000. At the same time, the plates' colour scheme changed to black characters on a yolk yellow background. The yolk yellow was replaced with a brighter lemon yellow in 1961, by which point the three-letter serial format had reached the mid 'C' series.
In October 1980, from KWO-050 onwards plates with reflective sheeting began to be issued. At the same time, the slogan "NSW – The Premier State" was added at the bottom of the plate; this was used until November 1988. Two further slogans followed, again appearing at the bottom of the plate: "NSW – The First State" from June 1989 to September 1994, and "NSW – Towards 2000" from September 1994 to September 1996. Since September 1996, car plates have carried the full state name at the bottom.
In the three-letter serial format, the letters I and Q were omitted originally, but were allowed from 1970. Several blocks of series were skipped, or were reserved for other vehicle types (see the Skipped Combinations section below). By July 2004, the format had reached the ZLF series, and was thus close to exhaustion. Hence, the current format was introduced, consisting of two letters, two numbers, and two more letters, starting at AA-00-AA.
Plates continue to consist of black characters on a lemon yellow background, with reflective sheeting.

Trailers

1910–1924: nnn•nnn
1924–1937: nnn•nnn
1937–1948: aa•nnn
1948–1981: aa•nnnn
1981–2014: a•nnnnnFrom 1910 to 1951, trailers (and caravans) used the same registration plates and serial formats as cars. In 1951, a separate serial format was introduced for trailers consisting of two letters followed by four numbers. The first letter progressed T, R, A, B and finally C, while the numeric combinations for each series ran from 1000 to 9999; the first serial was thus TA-1000, while the last was CS-9999. Plates continued to consist of white characters on a black background, while the colour scheme for car plates changed (above).
In August 1981, trailer plates adopted the same colour scheme as car plates, of black characters on a lemon yellow background. At the same time, a new serial format was introduced consisting of one letter followed by five numbers, starting at A-00000. This format omitted the letters I, O and T, and was exhausted in December 2014.
In August 2014, a new trailer plate was introduced consisting of black characters on a white background, and a plain "NSW" legend. This plate uses the same two-letter, two-number, two-letter serial format as car plates, but has T as the first letter, with the first serial being TR-00-AA. This serial format began to be used on the current mid yellow trailer plate as well from December 2014, beginning with TA-00-AA; at the same time, the legend on this plate was changed from the full state name to "NSW – TRAILER", the whole TI series was skipped.
Motorcycles

1910–1939: nn•nnn
1939–1950: aa•nn
1950–1961: aa•nnn
1961–1989: aa•nnnFrom 1910 to 1939, registration plates for motorcycles consisted of black characters on a white background, and used all-numeric serials of up to five numbers. On 10 July 1939, the colour scheme was reversed to white characters on a black base, and a serial format of two letters followed by two numbers was introduced, running from AA-00 to ZZ-99, with the letters I and Q skipped for the reasons described above. On 14 November 1950, the serial format was expanded to two letters followed by three numbers, starting at AA-000. As with car plates, the colour scheme changed at this point to black characters on a yolk yellow base, with the yolk yellow in turn being replaced with lemon yellow in 1961.
Since October 1980, motorcycles have been provided with one plate rather than two, and plates have been manufactured with reflective sheeting. The two-letter, three-number serial format was exhausted in August 1989, at which point the current format was introduced, consisting of three letters and two numbers, starting at ZZZ-99 and progressing backwards. In November 2009, a plate consisting of black characters on a white background was introduced, using the same serial format but starting at ABA-00 and progressing forwards. As of May 2021, there will be only H and I prefixes left to go as F,G and J prefixes are about to commence. Anticipate there will be a new series after the AAA-NN series will be exhausted prior to 2025 as an estimate only.

Fleet Plates: Fleet managers had plates allocated and issued for SG Fleet and Summit in full standard size and Fleet manager's business name printed below. SG Fleet plates has since changed to Dealer slimline size as reported in September 2015. Summit soon changed the size too. SG fleet plates are issued in BQA, CAA & CCB blocks and now into SGF. Summit Fleet was in CFF series but now moved over to SUM series.

Various dealer names are screenprinted at the top between embossed NSW with some printed bottom texts.General notes
When a black on yellow plate is judged to be in need of replacement, Transport for NSW are required to manufacture a replacement at no cost to the owner, hence it is quite common to see plates from older series in the current format. Registration plates, both personalised and standard, are able to be transferred between vehicles. A number of Sydney bus operators still recycle old plates including Forest Coach Lines and Punchbowl Bus Company. As of April 2023, Forest Coach Lines has been rebranded as CDC NSW and Punchbowl Bus Company will be exiting after bus contracts are awarded to another company.

Plate customisation has also been added into the coloured, premium range and recently motorcycles (7 March). Certain restrictions about combinations have been put in place to prevent people from designing plates which appear too much like numeral-only plates which are auctioned off separately (e.g. 9I2 would not be allowed as it is too similar to 912). There are also restrictions preventing people from picking combinations that are too similar to special plates issued by Transport for NSW (for instance, HC-nnn and HC-nnnn combinations are reserved only for accredited hire-car operators which is not currently newly issued).


== Special purpose vehicles ==

Vehicles with particular purposes in New South Wales have been introduced with numberplates specific to their type.

Taxis have two types of plate: Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong plates have a T·nnnn format, while regional and country taxis use TC·nnnn. As of October 2009, the Taxi plate design has changed to its current format following enforcement camera errors showing the zeros or eights between the character spaces. It has an embossed premium slimline at the top with sticker for LPG, CNG and TPG moved to two bottom corners. The white on blue reflective base remain the same. NSW -TAXI is the legend description. Taxi licensing is being reformed as per the Point to Point Transport reforms that would mean all existing taxi licensing will be cancelled and then a new taxi licence to be issued.
Tow truck plates use nnnn·TT or nnnn·TT and as of March 2018 123-TTT was seen on a table top tow truck nnn·TTT depending on the registered use of the vehicle. They have blue characters on a white background, and the top of the plate reads "TOW TRUCK", that was introduced in October 2000. The original yellow on black format with NSW The First state or Towards 2000 began in November 1990. It is now in the current NEW SOUTH WALES format and is seen to have 9906-TT as of 28 March 2008. As of September 2008 it is in 9800s series, but now it is issued in 7000 to 8999 unused blocks as the first one 7002-TT was seen at the Northern Beaches as of December 2008.
Buses have black on yellow plates, with the prefix Metro: M/O·nnnn, Country: nnnn·MO (Motor Omnibus)  Commercial buses in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong districts have M/O-nnnn plates, with the M over the O; all other country commercial buses use nnnn-MO. Like other vehicles, buses not used for hire or reward are registered with National Heavy Vehicle plates. The M/O·6nnn series was reserved for the Wollongong region, but now cancelled M/O 6000s series are re-issued to private buses in Sydney, which continues from M/O·5nnn series and into 8000s as of June 2019.
Tourist vehicles have black on yellow plates, with the prefix TV·nnna. Originally issued as yellow on black TV·nnn plates in the 1960s, before changed to reflective black on yellow format in the early 1980s. At the time the tourist coach market was heavily regulated with a finite number of TV plates on issue, making them like taxi plates a traded commodity. As of September 2018 it has reached TV-9999 and is reissuing cancelled blocks from TV-1000 onwards. Starting on 2 October 2019, new TV series commenced at TV-001A using last alpha suffix in place of numerical.
Police and emergency vehicles in New South Wales, such as ambulances and police vehicles, are using aaa-nna slimline plates for cars. Some police vehicles have had personalised plates fitted, for example several Highway Patrol vehicles have plates featuring the HWP series from 1975 and in recent decades the initials of officers killed on duty. During the 2010s HWP series were allocated to Police HWP motorcycles and VIP series during the 2000s, that continues to today. NSW Ambulance plates in 1937 had AC series plates allocated for the duration of the original AA-000 to ZZ-999 series. From the 1960s CDA series plates were allocated to Central District Ambulances in Sydney but no longer in use as was phased out in the 1980s.New South Wales Rural Fire Service vehicles were exempted from displaying registration plates, however some have been fitted with standard issue plates. New South Wales Fire Brigades vehicles were at one stage only fitted with brass plates featuring the letters "NSWFB". These plates were red on gold brass and from 1984, NSWFB plates were pressed into standard dies in gold and red base. It was withdrawn from 1991 when FBY-000 to FBY-999 was allocated that lasted until 2010 when it was replaced by the standard series. Fire trucks in NSW are now allocated the National Heavy Vehicle plates series while the auxiliary light vehicle continues to be allocated NSW general series yellow plates.
Conditional Registration Scheme nnnnn·E Conditional Motorcycle format: nnnn·N Forklift, Off-Road Vehicles, etc., that need to use public roads as part of their operation can be registered conditionally. As of June 2008, it is reported that the motorcycle sized series has overflowed to 0001-C onwards after reaching 9999-C then moved onto M and N suffix. By December 2021 15000-E suffix Conditional Plates are the latest issues. nnnn·U for machinery/tractors commenced in December 2013 starting as T suffix to balance between existing Conditional and Machinery/Tractors types. As of May 2018, it moved to U suffix series.
Rally vehicle plates: nnnnn·R Introduced in 2014,with the slogan NSW – Rally Vehicle.
Historic and veteran vehicles  Cars – nnnnn·J Cycles – nnnn·K Introduced in 2002 as current H series is in use. For vehicles used/registered for historical interest and not used as regular transport by financial members of an approved club and is classed as a conditional registration.
 Trade plates (current): in the format Annnn or nnnnA . Permanent trade plates have replaced white on orange annual trade plates effective 23 December 2015, with an embossed NSW and screened "Trade" legend: NSW – Trade. The RMS commenced issuing new style yellow perpetual trader plates during the 31 December 2015 renewal process. The following content ranges are reserved for the new style trader’s plates:A0000 to A9999 for vehicles.
0000A to 5999A for trailers—available from January 2017—using full premium embossed dies.
6000A to 9999A for motorcycles. Available from January 2017—using slimline embossed dies format and 5 character base that was later replaced by motorcycle sized plates following feedback from dealers.
This clarifies the allocation of trailer and motorcycle plates as B-series motorcycle trade plates have been discontinued and replaced by the allocation of 6000A to 9999A series. Trailers have moved to 0000A to 5999A replacing the three numeric blocks. This previous permanent arrangement existed from 1991 to 2003 in colour as shown: A·nnnn.CC Consular Plates – CC·nnnn Special purpose plates are used for consular corps since 1978 in CC-2000 to CC-4999 range, initially in white on blue then changed to black on yellow by August 1983, with the same legend at top NSW CONSULAR CORPS. The legend moved from top to the bottom from changeover to fat dies in October 1992 and since the variations of dies and bases were updated on a few occasions to the current style.
Visit to New South Wales: It is a red numerical only visit plates similar to the Commonwealth of Australia with inscription at top Visit to and bottom as New South Wales with the graphical state coat of arms at left side.


== Other purpose plates ==
NSW Auxiliary A supplementary plate to be displayed on a bike rack or other kind of racks displaying the duplicate number/alpha combination was introduced in October 1995, initially in black on off white non reflective and screenprinted legend as "NSW – BIKE RACK" . In 1998 it changed to black on reflective white, again on screenprinted legend. In 1999 the legend changed to embossed. In 2006 the legend reverted to full screen printed. In 2012 the name was changed to "NSW- AUXILIARY" again in screen printed. in 2016, the arrangements extended to tow trucks and other vehicles covered in this scheme and in December the legend was revised to add embossed NSW and the rest screen printed. As of October 2022, it once changed again back to the full embossed legend moving forward being the 7th version since its inception in 1995.

== Registration labels ==
From 1932, registration labels were introduced which corresponded to the vehicle's registration plate, and were displayed on the windscreen or side-windows of vehicles.
The label was a wet application type soaked in cold water which was then applied to the glass, then squeegeed with a clean sponge to remove remaining gum on the label. It was time consuming. In 1992, it changed to self-adhesive printed on registration certificates and continues for heavy vehicles after the abolition of labels for light vehicles.
