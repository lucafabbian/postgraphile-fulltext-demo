Steve Dylan is the stage name of Steve Patterson, a Canadian comedian and television writer from Kingston, Ontario, most noted as a writer for Still Standing.He studied engineering and urban planning at Queen's University, but decided during his studies that he wanted to be an actor instead. He had several television acting roles under his own name, most notably a recurring role as Phillip the Sound Guy in The Jon Dore Television Show, for which he was also a writer. He, Jon Dore and Mark Forward won the Canadian Comedy Award for Best Writing in a Series at the 9th Canadian Comedy Awards in 2008 for their work on the show.
When he branched out into stand-up comedy, he began using the stage name Steve Dylan, in part to avoid confusion with the already-established comedian Steve Patterson.
