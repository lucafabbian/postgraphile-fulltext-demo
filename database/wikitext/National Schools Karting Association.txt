NatSKA (The National Schools and Youth Group Karting Association) was formed over forty years ago in the north east, by a group of like minded people intent on making motorsport accessible to schoolchildren. One of their primary objectives was to make kart racing as affordable to as many people as possible whilst maintaining a high level of competition.
Kart racing in schools has existed since the late sixties. NatSKA is a nationwide association that holds race meetings throughout the country at major racetracks such as Blackbushe, Glan-y-Gors, Kimbolton, Rowrah, Rye House, Buckmore park and Whilton Mill. The association has 27 teams as far apart as Tyne and Wear through to Kent and Devon. In March 2008, St Michael's, a school which was a member of the NatSKA, had three karts stolen from their school base. Tarporley Karting Team had three karts stolen in 2019 from their school base.
All race meetings are run by NatSKA under the authority of the Motorsport UK (MSUK) who are responsible for all motor sport in the United Kingdom, including British Touring Cars, Formula 3, Formula Renault and all motorcycle racing including the Moto GP British Grand Prix.
Karting as a school activity covers a wide range of educational, academic, technological, social and sporting subjects.
