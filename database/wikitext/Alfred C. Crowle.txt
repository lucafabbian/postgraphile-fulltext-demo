In 1900, the then President of Mexico, Gen. Porfirio Díaz, awarded mining concessions to British mining companies. Cornish miners working in the mines of Pachuca and Real Del Monte practised football as a pastime and later went on to form the Real del Monte Pachuca Athletic Club, historically considered the first organized team on Mexican soil, then came the Reformation Athletic Club, the British Club, and the Mexico Cricket Club, among others.The other main drivers of this sport were Mr. Percy Clifford and Mr. Robert J. Blackmoore who, together with Crowle, brought the rules of the game and the first regulated matches to Mexico. From 1917 to 1920, C. F. Pachuca was champion of the newly formed league, under Crowle.
