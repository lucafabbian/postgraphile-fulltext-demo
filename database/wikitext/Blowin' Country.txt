Blowin' Country is an album by saxophonists Bud Shank and Bob Cooper released on the World Pacific label. The majority of the album's tracks were recorded in 1958, with one track from 1956 on the original album, and the CD reissue added five bonus tracks from the two sessions.


== Reception ==
The AllMusic review by Scott Yanow states: "Shank and Cooper display distinctive but complementary styles, and their tripling on woodwinds gives plenty of variety to the date. Cooper's oboe playing, which preceded Yusef Lateef's, in particular is a joy. Highly recommended". On the All About Jazz website, Jack Bowers observed "these two masters offer a comprehensive clinic in good old–fashioned swinging... Multi–instrumentalists Shank and Cooper let it all hang out, skipping comfortably through a colorful program that consists mostly of standards... Shank and Cooper know how to make every note count, and their solos, while perhaps briefer than one might wish, are always inspiring."
