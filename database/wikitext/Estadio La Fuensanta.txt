The Estadio La Fuensanta is a multi-use stadium located in Cuenca, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. 
It is currently used for football matches and is the home stadium of UB Conquense.


== History ==
The Fuensata was opened in the 1940s, and UB Conquense began to play home games here since its foundation in 1946. With the promotion of Conquense to Segunda B in the 1997-98 season, the stadium didn't meet the needs of the club.
