Lombard was born in La Ciotat, but his family moved to Martigues when he was a few years old. His father, Paul-Baptistin Lombard, who took part in the French Resistance, was shot and killed by the Germans on 13 June 1944.Lombard entered the municipal council of Martigues in 1953 following the resignation of his mother. That year, he led the French Communist Party's (PCF) ticket against incumbent Mayor Paul Pascal of the French Section of the Workers' International. In 1959, Francis Turcan was elected mayor, and Lombard became his financial assistant. Then during the Turcan administration, Martigues began its modernization, moving on from its industrial past.

A new library was built in 1981 and a new town hall was constructed in 1983. In 1993, the Halle de Martigues was built, and, in 1995, the Théâte des Salins.
