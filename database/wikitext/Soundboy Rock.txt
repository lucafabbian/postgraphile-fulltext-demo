== Critical reception ==
Although the duo claimed the album was their best, the reviews were not always positive. In a three-star review for Slant Magazine, Dave Hughes criticised Groove Armada's lack of innovation, but praised the level of execution on the record. His observed that the album "manages to be familiar without being boring" concluding that "though it fails to inspire, it also, happily, fails to annoy." John Burghess of The Guardian was of a similar opinion calling the album "derivative, but sparky and well-executed." Writing for Pitchfork, Tom Ewing agreed with the duo's claim that Soundboy Rock was their best offering, but commented that their creative limitations were also obvious. He noted that every track missed a "killer idea that would make it vital." Two tracks did stand out for him, however: the first single, "Get Down," and the follow up, "Song 4 Mutya," which he called inspired.A very positive review came from Gemma Padley of BBC. She described the album as eclectic and unpredictable, with every track representing a different genre as breakbeat, electropop, trip hop, electro-reggae and grime. Despite this, she commented, the album maintains continuity.
