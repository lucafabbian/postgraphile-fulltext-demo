The following year, her breakthrough occurred at the US Open where, as the world No. 92, she soared to her first Grand Slam semifinal where she fell in three sets to the ninth seed and eventual champion Samantha Stosur.

Her second career title came shortly later, in April, at the Danish Open where she beat former world No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki. She then achieved her career-best result at the French Open by making the quarterfinals, before posting a runner-up result in Eastbourne and a semifinal showing at Wimbledon where she lost to Agnieszka Radwańska.
