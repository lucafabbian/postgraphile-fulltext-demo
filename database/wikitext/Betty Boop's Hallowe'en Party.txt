Betty Boop's Hallowe'en Party is a 1933 Fleischer Studios animated short film starring Betty Boop.


== Plot ==
It is Halloween, and Jack Frost (in his ice-covered airplane) covers the fields with frost.  A chilly scarecrow plucks a wind-blown piece of paper out of the air; it is an invitation to Betty's Hallowe'en party ("p.s., Bring Your Lunch").  Betty is mass-producing jack o'lanterns with the help of her animal friends.  The partygoers arrive, and join with Betty in song.  Meanwhile, a hulking gorilla gatecrashes the party, and threatens to ruin the evening.  Betty disguises as a black cat, and her friends turn the table on the beast, and scare him out the party.


== Production notes ==
Betty sings "Let's All Sing Like the Birdies Sing", which features background vocals sung by fellow voice actress Mae Questel along with a studio chorus.
