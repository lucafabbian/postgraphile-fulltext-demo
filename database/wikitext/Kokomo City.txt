== Production ==
D. Smith had a successful career in the music industry, producing songs for Lil Wayne, Ciara, Keri Hilson, Billy Porter and Andr√© 3000. However, when she began to transition, she was essentially forced out of the industry, and ended up broke and homeless. Smith had the idea for a documentary film revolving around sex work, after wondering what would happen if she had to turn to it to sustain herself, and those who had no other options. Smith was still homeless when she began working on the project, with a camera being purchased by a host of where she was once staying, and a laptop by a producer.To find subjects for the film, Smith turned to Instagram and YouTube.  Smith wanted her subjects to feel comfortable, telling them to talk as if they were talking to her and shooting at lower angles to make it look as if they were at a sleepover. Lena Waithe and her producing partner, Rishi Rajani boarded the film as executive producers after having been blowed away after viewing the film.
