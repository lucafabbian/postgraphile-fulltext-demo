Exum Glacier (73°30′S 94°14′W) is a small glacier flowing north between Hughes Point and Bonnabeau Dome, in the Jones Mountains of Antarctica. It was mapped by the University of Minnesota – Jones Mountains Party, 1960–61, and was named by the party for Glenn Exum, a mountaineer who provided training in rock and ice climbing for the University of Minnesota field parties of 1960–61 and 1961–62.
