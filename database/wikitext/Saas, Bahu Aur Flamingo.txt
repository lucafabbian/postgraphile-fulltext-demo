== Reception ==
The Hindu wrote "The series is entertaining for its mollycoddling (in a mocking way) of fragile male egos."Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV wrote "No matter how firm and focussed the unbending Savitri is, reverses are a part of her existence. A backstory reveals the reasons behind the transformation of a Banjara woman into an imperious and impetuous ringleader."Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com felt the series overdoses on sex, violence and drugs and wrote in her review "There are attempts to document its crooked universe and its shady workings in detail like Farzi but none of the spunk. Guns and ghagras make for a fine punchline but the imagery feels bland in absence of emotions."A critic from India Today rated the series 3.5 stars out of 5 and wrote "Saas, Bahu Aur Flamingo is a show where women are the frontrunners. Thereâ€™s no running-in-your-face feminism. It just feels too fair and fresh, different from the imposed shows of the same nature that you see. Here, women are no abla but can take on hordes of men, even when they are the least prepared."The Times of India wrote "The show's setting in the parched and arid land of north-western India is pitch perfect, and the costumes and makeup of each character is impressive. The rustic makeovers complete with ancient tattoos and ethnic ornaments have the requisite detailing."
