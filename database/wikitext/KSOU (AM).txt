KSOU (1090 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a Spanish adult hits format. Serving the Sioux Center area in the U.S. state of Iowa, the station is licensed to Community First Broadcasting. KSOU previously carried a classic hits format and before that, a Christian Contemporary format.
1090 AM is a United States and Mexican clear-channel frequency; KSOU must leave the air from sunset to sunrise to prevent interference to the skywave signals of the Class A stations.
On February 5, 2020, KSOU changed their format from classic hits to Spanish adult hits, branded as "Sioux Ritmo".
