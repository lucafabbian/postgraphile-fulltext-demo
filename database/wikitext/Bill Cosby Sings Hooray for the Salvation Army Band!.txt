Bill Cosby Sings Hooray for the Salvation Army Band! (1968) is the seventh album by Bill Cosby. This was his second studio album to feature his singing, and features less serious renditions (often with satirical lyrics written or improvised by Cosby) of then-current rock and soul hits. As on his previous, debut music album Silver Throat, he is backed by the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band.
The title track is actually a parody set to the tune of Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze", although Hendrix is not credited, while "Funky North Philadelphia" is also a parody of the Dyke and the Blazers / Wilson Pickett song "Funky Broadway".
