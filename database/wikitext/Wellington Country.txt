Wellington Country was a former parliamentary electorate in the Wellington Region from 1853 to 1860 and then 1871 to 1881. The seat covered Miramar, Mākara, Porirua, the Kapiti Coast and the Horowhenua District.


== History ==

William Barnard Rhodes was the first representative of Wellington Country. He served until the dissolution of Parliament in 1855 and (unsuccessfully) contested the City of Wellington electorate instead. The 1855 election was won by Dudley Ward, who resigned in 1858. The ensuing 1858 by-election was won by Alfred Brandon, who served until the dissolution of Parliament in 1860.From 1860 to 1870, Wellington Country was replaced by the Porirua electorate, held by Brandon.  Wellington Country was re-established for the 1871 election. Brandon was challenged by Edward Thomas Gillon. Whilst there was criticism of Brandon not having had a good connection to his electorate, Brandon won with a solid majority. The next election in 1875 was contested by Gillon, Brandon, and J. H. Wallace. Brandon was again successful and received 208 votes versus 141 for Gillon, with Wallace a distant last. Brandon won the 1879 election and at the end of the parliamentary term in 1881, he retired from politics, and the Wellington Country electorate was abolished.From 1911 to 1919 the geographic area was combined with Wellington Suburbs into Wellington Suburbs and Country.
