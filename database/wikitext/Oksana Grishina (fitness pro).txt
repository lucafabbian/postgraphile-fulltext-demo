When she was 10 years her father was reassigned to a new post in Russia. This job came with a guarantee of government housing, which meant that, finally, they would be in a settled place. However, there was no gymnastics school in that city. Her coach in Riga offered her the chance to stay there and continue her training. Finally her father got to move her family to Kaliningrad but they changed apartments often and she moved from school to school.
