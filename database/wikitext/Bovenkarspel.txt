In March 1999 an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease occurred during a flower exhibition in Bovenkarspel. Many people were hospitalized in Hoorn. 318 people became ill and at least 32 died. Probably more victims died and were buried before the legionellosis infection was recognized. The source of the bacteria was probably a whirlpool and a humidifier in the exhibition area.
