Born in Bedford, Bedfordshire, Beckwith joined Luton Town as an under-8 and signed a development contract in October 2019. He joined Southern League Premier Division Central club Biggleswade Town on 6 February 2020 on a one-month youth loan, which was later extended by a further month.

He was named Luton Town Young Player of the Season at the club's end of season awards. Luton took up the option to extend Beckwith's contract in July 2021. Beckwith made his senior debut in a 2–2 away draw with Stevenage in the EFL Cup first round on 10 August 2021, which Luton lost 3–0 in a penalty shoot-out. He was loaned out to National League club Maidenhead United on 27 August 2021 for the 2021–22 season. He made 31 appearances for the Magpies during the season. At the end of the 2021-22 season, he was released by the Hatters. Following his release, Beckwith returned to Maidenhead United on a permanent basis in June 2022.
