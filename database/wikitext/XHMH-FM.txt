== History ==
XHMH, originally XEMH-AM, is among the oldest radio stations in southeastern Mexico. It began on 1400 kHz, with a concession awarded to Álvaro Barquet Y. in 1941. The station, then known as "La Voz del Trópico", came to air in September of that year. The station was sold to Manuel Araujo Echeverría, its founder, in 1951, and then to Radio Mérida, S.A., and by the 1960s had moved to its final dial position of 970; it broadcast with 5,000 watts day and 500 night.
It was authorized to become an AM-FM combo in 1994. On January 30, 2018, Cadena RASA informed the Federal Telecommunications Institute that it was opting to surrender its AM frequency.
