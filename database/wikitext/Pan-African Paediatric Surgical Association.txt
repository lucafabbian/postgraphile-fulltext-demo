== History ==
During the 38th British Association of Paediatric Surgeons (BAPS) conference in Budapest in 1991, the concept of an Association representing Africa was proposed with 9 paediatric surgeons from Africa who attended the meeting.As the idea needed international recognition and support, the World Federation of Associations of Pediatric Surgeons (WOFAPS) gave  support during the development phases of the as yet to be established Association.
