The following is a list of state forests in the U.S. state of Michigan. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources manages the largest state forest system in the nation (2.8 million acres (16,000 km2)), administered by the Forest Resources Division.
In literature describing recreational uses of state forest lands, six state forests are identified. However, state forest lands are administered by fifteen DNR Forest Management Units (FMU).  There is no state forest land in the southern portion of the Lower Peninsula.
