== History ==
The city of Lincoln had been an ancient borough and was made a county corporate in 1409 with its own court of quarter sessions, making it independent from the Lindsey Quarter Sessions. The borough corporation was reformed under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 to become a municipal borough. When elected county councils were established under the Local Government Act 1888 to take over the local government functions of the quarter sessions, Lincoln retained its independence, becoming a county borough, therefore running independently from Lindsey County Council.On 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, Lincoln was reconstituted to become a non-metropolitan district, altering its powers and responsibilities but keeping the same area and name. The separate county councils which had existed for each of the Parts of Lincolnshire were also amalgamated to create a single Lincolnshire County Council for the first time, with responsibility for county-level services in the city of Lincoln too.
