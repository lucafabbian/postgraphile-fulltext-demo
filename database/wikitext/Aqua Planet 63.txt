Hanwha Aqua Planet 63 is an aquarium that opened in 1985 in the 63 Building, Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea. It was the first public aquarium in the country. The 63 Building was the tallest building in Korea when it was built, and is still an iconic building in Seoul. The aquarium hosts about 1,000,000 visitors each year.


== History ==
The aquarium was opened in 1985, occupying 5,630 square metres (60,600 sq ft) of the three basement levels in the 63 Building (the third basement is an equipment level and not open to the public). Its mission was to "be a center of education for those interested in learning more about marine life," and it reproduced ocean habitats from around the world. The harbor seal show opened in 1990, and is still showing daily.
In 2016, Seaworld 63 was renovated and re-opened, and named as Aquaplanet 63.


== Animals ==
Aqua Planet 63 is currently home to 20,000+ animals representing 400+ species, including king penguin, jackass penguin, pirarucu, piranha, Oriental small-clawed otter, harbor seal, sea lion.
