== Critical reception ==
Star Smile Strong received positive acclaim upon release. Nick Hall of Fatea magazine states that 'It almost seems like lazy writing to point out that, in a parallel universe somewhere, Ian is striding the world stages like a U2-sized behemoth, and that it's criminal that, in this universe, he's not. However, those in the know (a large catchment that is ever-growing, actually), know that - as well as being one of our most charismatic live performers, Ian McNabb is up there as one of the finest singer-songwriters and guitarists that these isles have ever produced. This album will delight that large, growing fan-base and should, with the aid of word-of-mouth, draw even more people in.' Similarly, Nigel Cartner of Sonic Bandwagon noted that 'This is a highly recommended album – one of the best of the year from a man who’s no stranger to producing excellence throughout his illustrious career.'
