The title of the mixtape refers to both artists' home state of Louisiana, in which YoungBoy is from Baton Rouge and Birdman is from New Orleans.

== Release and promotion ==
YoungBoy and Birdman were originally set to release From the Bayou on March 22, 2018, but this did not happen for unknown reasons. Around the same time of its original announcement, Birdman revealed the cover art and the then-tracklist. However, the mixtape was pushed back more than three-and-a-half years for unknown reasons. On November 30, 2021, Birdman announced the release date of the mixtape of December 3, 2021, with an updated tracklist, but the mixtape was not released on that date and was released exactly one week later.


=== Songs ===
Before the release of From the Bayou, YoungBoy released a few songs from the mixtape to his YouTube channel, which were not officially released. The first visual was for "Safe then Sorry", which was released on November 23, 2021. He then released a combined music video for "Heart & Soul" and "Alligator Walk" on December 2, 2021. The final unofficial song with a music video was "Black Ball", which was released on December 6, 2021. All songs were only performed by YoungBoy even though Birdman is credited on every song from the mixtape.


== Critical reception ==
Writing for AllMusic, Paul Simpson felt that "while Birdman executive produced the project and appears on a handful of tracks, mostly at the beginning, the mixtape largely feels like a YoungBoy solo release, and delivers what fans of the highly prolific artist have come to expect", citing YoungBoy's "generally intense and volatile" raps, which occasionally "show a more vulnerable side". Stephen Kearse of Pitchfork similarly stated that while "Birdman's presence is largely intrusive on the pair's joint project", "it's YoungBoy's versatility that keeps the album afloat" and "for most of its runtime, the tape centers YoungBoy, who croons, yelps, and wails with his usual intensity and anguish, sharing glimpses of his life under house arrest after another jail bid", "but YoungBoy's caterwauling only barely conceals the emptiness of the project", adding that "although Birdman postures as a mentor and fellow artist inspired by his young partner's talent and drive, he is foremost an investor, and YoungBoy stock is hot". Writing for Revolt, DJ First Class felt that the mixtape's "thoroughness cannot be denied". Shawn Grant of The Source opined that the songs on the mixtape see YoungBoy and Birdman "fusing magnetically melodic hooks with diamond-encrusted lyrical flexes".
