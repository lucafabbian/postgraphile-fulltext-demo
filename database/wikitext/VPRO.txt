The VPRO (stylized vpro; originally an acronym for Vrijzinnig Protestantse Radio Omroep, lit. 'Liberal Protestant Radio Broadcaster') is a Dutch public broadcaster, that is part of the Dutch public broadcasting system. It was founded in 1926 as a liberal Protestant radio station. In the 1950s and 1960s it gradually became social liberal rather than Protestant, and the original meaning of the acronym was eventually dropped.
In 1967, VPRO was the first station in the Netherlands to show a nude woman – Phil Bloom – on national television. VPRO is known for producing sometimes avant-garde programs, documentaries and films. VPRO's target audience consists mainly of highly educated and creative people (e.g. artists, designers, scientists).Like all public broadcasters in the Netherlands, VPRO does not have its own television channel.  VPRO often cooperates with foreign broadcasters such as WDR, the BBC and Arte.
