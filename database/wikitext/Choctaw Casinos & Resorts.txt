== History ==

The Choctaw Casino Resort sits on a 50-acre site, adjacent to the former Choctaw Casino Bingo. The Choctaw Casino Bingo was built in 1987 and was the first of the Choctaw gaming franchise. In 2006, the original $60 million resort (now known as the Link Casino) was completed with construction. Soon after completion, tribal officials determined they built too small for their clientele and went underway with an expansion. In February 2010, a larger casino was built adjacent to the existing resort and became known as the Grand Casino. The Grand Hotel Tower is built atop the Grand Casino. The Bingo Hall then closed, shortly after the opening of the expansion.
