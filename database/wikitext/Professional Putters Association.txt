The Professional Putters Association (PPA) was started in 1959 by Don Clayton, the founder of Putt-Putt Golf, in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Originally begun as the Professional Putt-Putt Golfers Association in 1959, the name was changed in 1960 to the Professional Putters Association. The organization was formed to provide tournaments and competition for those who viewed putting as a sport. Since 1959, the PPA has held a National Championship Tournament.
The PPA has awarded over $8,000,000 in prize money over the past 52 years. Billy Packer, best known  for his work on college basketball telecasts for both NBC and CBS, and Frank Glieber, longtime sportscaster for CBS, served as the announcers for the Putt-Putt Golf Courses Championship TV series.
