It dwells at a depth  of 10–60 m, most commonly between 20 and 60 m, and leads a nonmigratory, benthic lifestyle, inhabiting reefs in colonies. They likely spawn during the warm season. The larval state of development lasts for about 6–8 months. Adult males can reach a maximum total length of 51 centimetres (20 in; 1.67 ft).The brown garden eel's diet consists primarily of detritus and plankton.
