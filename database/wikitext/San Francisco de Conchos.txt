It is a young missionary who made these expeditions in search of indigenous villages to take the gospel to the inhabitants: Fray Alonso de la Oliva.
In moving towards the north he came to the source of the Ojo de San Antonio (now Ojo de Agua). By following the course of water that flowed through the shoal in the course of the millennium, he came to the confluence with the Rio Conchos. Before falling to the river waters they formed a small lake (Galeana) and that is where the Fray Alonso de la Oliva found the people of this area that they called Indians Coyamus. The mission followed visiting them and also helped by indigenous guides arrived to villages who would become Santa Cruz de Tepacolmes (Rosales), San Pablo (Meoqui), San Antonio (Julimes), San Lucas and San Pedro of Conchos on the banks of San Pedro. The founding of the mission would be these their villages farthest visit.
