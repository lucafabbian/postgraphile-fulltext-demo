Through the 1960s and 1970s, Canada produced a remarkable number of world-class swimmers and Lay is notable for her contributions to that success.

At the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, she finished fifth in 100m freestyle. Four years later in Mexico City, she placed fourth in the event.

At the 1967 Pan American Games, Lay won four silver medals. She won the 1965 ASA National Championship 100 metres freestyle title.
