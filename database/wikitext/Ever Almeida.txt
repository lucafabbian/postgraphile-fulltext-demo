== Career ==


=== As player ===
Almeida made his professional debut in 1967 at the age of 19 playing for C.A. Cerro of Montevideo. After a few years in the Uruguayan football league he was transferred to Club Guaraní of Paraguay. Shortly afterwards, in 1973, he received an offer from Olimpia. From that point on Almeida played with Olimpia for nearly two decades, setting a record for being the player with most appearances in the Copa Libertadores with 113, from 1973 to 1990, winning the tournament on two occasions (1979 and 1990). He also won the Intercontinental Cup (1979), Supercopa Sudamericana (1990), and the Recopa Sudamericana (1991), along with several Paraguayan national championships with Olimpia.
Almeida was an extremely good penalty saver, a skill that helped Olimpia win both international and national championships. Past the age of 40 he decided to retire and became a legend for the Paraguayan club due to all his contributions and titles obtained throughout the years.


=== As coach ===
After retiring as a player, Almeida worked in sports journalism and later became a coach of teams like Sol de América and Olimpia of Paraguay, Municipal of Guatemala, Nacional of Quito and Barcelona SC of Ecuador; and he even coached the Paraguay national team in 1999 during the Copa América. In August 2008, Almeida was chosen as the new coach of Olimpia replacing Gustavo Costas, marking his return to the club since 1993.
Almeida achieved success as a coach by winning championships in Paraguay, Guatemala and Ecuador.
He also coached Club Nacional of Paraguay.
In May 2010 Almeida was appointed as the new coach of Guatemala.
