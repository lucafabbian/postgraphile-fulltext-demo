== Media ==
In January, 2008, AIDS.gov started a blog on how to use new media tools in response to HIV/AIDS. The blog has since expanded to cover HIV policy and research, as well as new media. AIDS.gov is also engaged in other new media activities —from maintaining a presence on social media sites such as Twitter and YouTube to promoting a text messaging campaign with the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mobile phone users can text their ZIP code to KNOWIT (566948) and will receive the location of their nearest HIV testing center.In recognition of the 20th World AIDS Day on December 1, 2008, AIDS.gov took part in several key new media activities: the Facing AIDS initiative, Bloggers Unite for World AIDS Day, and Second Life World AIDS Day events.In recognition of World AIDS Day on December 1, 2009, AIDS.gov again hosted the Facing AIDS initiative, among other activities. Facing AIDS encouraged people around the country (and world) to take a photo of themselves saying why they were "Facing AIDS" for World AIDS Day and to upload the photo to the Facing AIDS group on Flickr. Over 850 photos were submitted to the Facing AIDS group, and Flickr featured the initiative on its blog.For National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) 2009, June 27, AIDS.gov shared testing messages from President Obama, and HHS Secretary Sebelius and DC Mayor Fenty. As part of NHTD 2009, AIDS.gov produced the “I Know. I Took the Test” blog series that highlighted campaigns focused on sharing personal HIV testing stories from organizations such as The Positive Project, Southern AIDS Living Quilt, National Association of People with AIDS, and POZ.  In addition, in collaboration with the CDC, AIDS.gov developed and promoted an accompanying widget with videos from the campaigns, and with the President's NHTD message.For National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) on June 27, 2010, AIDS.gov worked with HUD's Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS Program, SAMHSA's Center for Mental Health Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the CDC, and others to develop the HIV/AIDS Prevention & Service Provider Locator. By entering a location (ZIP code, city and state), an individual can locate nearby prevention, housing, mental health, substance abuse, testing, and treatment services. The locator is a widget that allows organizations and individuals to share the locator on their own blog or website.
