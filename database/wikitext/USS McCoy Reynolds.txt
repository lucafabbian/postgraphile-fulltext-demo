USS McCoy Reynolds (DE-440) was a John C. Butler-class destroyer escort acquired by the U.S. Navy during World War II. The primary purpose of the destroyer escort was to escort and protect ships in convoy, in addition to other tasks as assigned, such as patrol or radar picket. Post-war, after operating in the Pacific Ocean battle areas, her crew members returned home with four battle stars to their credit for World War II and one for the Korean War.
The ship was named in honor of Marine Private McCoy Reynolds (1916-1942), who was killed in action on Guadalcanal on 25 November 1942, after exposing himself to destroy a Japanese machine gun nest in the defense of Henderson Field, for which he was posthumously awarded the Silver Star.
