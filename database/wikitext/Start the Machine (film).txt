== Filming and production ==
Start the Machine was filmed over a course of almost 3 years. During this time, Tom DeLonge and David Kennedy (both guitarists from the band) contacted Mark Eaton and asked him to direct this documentary. Both DeLonge and Kennedy had known him for years. Eaton was trusted with the quality of the documentary completely; DeLonge never saw it or approved or disapproved anything before it was submitted to film festivals; he had "nothing to do with putting it together". Eaton would later go on to direct the videos for "Secret Crowds" and "Breathe" by Angels & Airwaves as well.
