Ski ballet is a form of ballet performed on skis.  It is very similar to figure skating, combining spins, jumps, and flips in a two-minute routine choreographed to music.  It was part of the professional freestyle skiing tours of the 1970s and 1980s and then an official FIS and Olympic discipline until the year 2000. Ski ballet became known as Acroski in the 1990s in an effort to legitimize its place among the competitive ski community, especially to the FIS. It is no longer a part of competitive freestyle skiing.


== Overview ==
Ski ballet involved a choreographed routine of flips, rolls, leg crossings, jumps, and spins performed on a smooth slope. After the mid-1970s, the routine was performed to music for 90 seconds. For a short period of time (in the 1980s), there were also pair ballet competitions, a variation of ballet where two people performed tricks that not only included spins, jumps, and leg crossing, but also lifts and synchronic movements. A panel of judges scored the performance similarly to figure skating.

== Olympic demonstration sport and decline in popularity ==

Ski ballet's increasing popularity led it being chosen as a demonstration sport for the 1988 and 1992 Winter Olympics. The popularity of the sport, however, significantly declined after 1992 due to the fact that it was not upgraded to Olympic sport status as well as due to the increasing popularity of snowboarding and other snow sports among young skiers. By 2000, the sport for all intents and purposes disappeared from international competition when the International Ski Federation ceased all formal competitions.
