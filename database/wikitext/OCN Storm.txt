In their opening season, the Storm won just two games out of 36, finishing last in the league standings, thus missing the playoffs. The following season they improved their record to 12–21–0–1, finishing third in the new four-team North Division. They fell in the first round of the playoffs being swept by the Arborg Ice Dawgs.
In their third season of 2014–15 the Storm finished fifth in the league and won their first-ever playoff series against the North Winnipeg Satelites. OCN was eliminated in the second round by the Peguis Juniors.
The league again split into two divisions for 2015-2016 season. OCN Storm met up with the Juniors in a rematch of the previous season, coming out short dropping the series 4 games to 2.
