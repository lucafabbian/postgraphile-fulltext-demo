Richard Wright (born London, 1960) is an English artist and musician. 
Wright was born in London. His family moved to Scotland when he was young. He attended Edinburgh College of Art from 1978 to 1982 and studied at Glasgow School of Art between 1993 and 1995 studying for a Master of Fine Art. He lives in Glasgow. and Norfolk.


== Work ==
Wright decorates architectural spaces with intricately designed geometric patterns in paint and gold leaf. He has produced a wide range of works made on paper, from prints on poster paper to elaborate and complex large-scale works that can include thousands of hand drawn and painted marks.
Wright's paintings are often short-lived, only surviving the length of an exhibition, they are painted over at the end of the show. This often seems to heighten the senses of the viewer in the knowledge that the work may not be viewable again, in any other place, at any other time.
Turner Prize judge Andrea Schlieker described him as a "painter who rejects the canvas"; fellow judge Jonathan Jones called him a "modern fresco painter". Wright injects complex works into often overlooked architectural spaces.  However in recent years Wright has installed numerous permanent works in the collections of MoMA, New York; Museum Abteiberg, Mönchengladbach; Middlesbrough Institute of Modern Art, Middlesbrough; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Tate Gallery, London; Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Edinburgh, Scotland, Tate Britain, London, England, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, Netherlands, Queen’s House, Royal Museums Greenwich, London, England and Tottenham Court Road Elizabeth Line Station, London, England.
On 7 December 2009, Wright received the Turner Prize 2009 for his golden fresco, no title, on the walls of Tate Britain's second room.
