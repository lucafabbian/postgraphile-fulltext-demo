111th is a proposed rapid transit station for the Red Line as part of the Red Line Extension. The station is planned to open in 2029, if the CTA can get the funding for the $3.6 billion project. The station would be constructed adjacent to the Union Pacific Railroad in Chicago's Roseland neighborhood.
