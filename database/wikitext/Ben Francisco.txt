He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Philadelphia Phillies, Toronto Blue Jays, Houston Astros, Tampa Bay Rays, and New York Yankees.


== Early life ==
He is a 1999 graduate of Servite High School, a Roman Catholic high school for boys, in Anaheim, California where he played on the same baseball team as former Indians teammate Ryan Garko. He later attended and played baseball at Cypress Junior College in 2000 and went on to play at the University of California, Los Angeles in 2001 through 2003.


== Professional career ==


=== Cleveland Indians ===
He was selected by the Cleveland Indians in the fifth round (154th overall) of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft.
He was called up from the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on May 1, 2007,
and made his major league debut that night as a late-game defensive replacement. On June 29, 2007, Francisco got his first hit and his first home run in his first major league start. His home run came leading off the bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Indians a 2–1, walk-off win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.


=== Philadelphia Phillies ===
On July 29, 2009, Francisco was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with reigning Cy Young Award winner Cliff Lee, for a selection of top minor league prospects including Carlos Carrasco, Jason Donald, Lou Marson, and Jason Knapp.He spent the remainder of 2009 and the entire 2010 season as a reserve outfielder and pinch hitter with the Phillies.  Following the departure of starting right fielder Jayson Werth, Francisco earned a regular spot in the Phillies' starting lineup at the onset of the 2011 season. By mid season, however, Francisco returned to his reserve role.
Though limited in play during the second half of the year, this year Francisco will most notably be remembered for his clutch performance in Game 3 of the 2011 NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals. In a scoreless game, with Shane Victorino on second, the Cardinals elected to intentionally walk Carlos Ruiz in order to face Francisco.
