The Kyiv Water Museum (official name the Water-Information Centre) is an educational centre that occupies one of the buildings from the early centralised water-supply system in the city which was built at the middle of the 19th century. It is located in Khreshchatyi Park. The Water-Information Centre gives information about water resources and their rational consumption.
