The journal was established in 1975 at Pergamon Press by the late Anthony Hopwood, who subsequently took an active role as editor through promoting conferences and releasing editorial statements that helped to identify emerging areas of accounting research. Hopwood and colleagues defined the programmatic aims of the journal in its early years. Following Hopwood's retirement at the end of 2009, Christopher Chapman was appointed editor-in-chief, serving from the beginning of 2010 until 2015, when Keith Robson took on the role.
