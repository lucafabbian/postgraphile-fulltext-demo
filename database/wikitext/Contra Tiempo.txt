Contra Tiempo is the sixth studio album released by Filipino alternative rock band Sandwich in 2011. The album contains the singles "Putik", which is inspired by Typhoon Ondoy (international name: Ketsana) and its effects, and "Lakad". The album name, which roughly translates to against the beat, comes from a line in the song "Sulputin". This is their first album with no English songs. There was an error in printing, listing "Dispalinghado" as track number 4 instead of "Stranded".
