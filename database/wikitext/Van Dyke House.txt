The Van Dyke House near Rivals, Kentucky was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The county that surrounds the Van Dyke House is Spencer County.
It is a one-and-a-half-story, three-bay, dry-stone hall-parlor plan house, 24 by 35 feet (7.3 m Ã— 10.7 m) in plan.  It was built of Upper Ordovician limestone. 
In the 1990s, the house was surrounded by grasslands, hundreds of trees, and a shed on the side for storage. Currently, the house is modernized and suburban-like, fitting well into the community.
