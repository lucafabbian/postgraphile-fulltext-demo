According to legend, Karumariamman once disguised herself as a soothsayer and visited the sun-god Surya to predict his future. Surya ignored Karumariamman, refusing to grant her an audience. Angered, the goddess departed. The moment Karumariamman left his abode, Surya started losing his lustre. Soon he was turned into a large coal, causing the earth to plunge into darkness and chaos to reign in the universe. Surya realised his mistake and asked for forgiveness. To pacify Karumariamman, Surya promised that twice a year, he would touch her feet. Karumariamman blessed Surya and he regained his lost lustre. Today, the sun rays fall directly on the feet of Karumariamman at her abode of Thiruverkadu.
