The Lyulka AL-5 was a Soviet axial compressor turbojet developed from the Lyulka TR-3 turbojet around 1950. It was flight-tested in a number of prototype aircraft, but was not accepted for production.


== Design and development ==
The Lyulka TR-3A was redesignated as the AL-5 to honor Arkhip Mikhailovich Lyulka in 1950. It was a single-shaft turbojet with a seven-stage axial compressor. It had an annular combustion chamber with 24 nozzles and a single-stage turbine. It had a fixed exhaust nozzle and had a turbine starting unit.It was used in the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-350, but flamed out when it was throttled back on that aircraft's first flight on 16 June 1951. It was also flown in the Lavochkin La-190 in 1951, but suffered similar problems. The AL-5 was modified as the AL-5G in an attempt to rectify the flame-out problem, which also increased its thrust by 2 kN (450 lbf), and was successfully flown in the prototype Ilyushin Il-46 bomber during 1952, but was not placed into production when the Tupolev Tu-16 was ordered into production instead of the Il-46.
