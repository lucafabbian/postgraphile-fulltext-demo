Following the 2016 Cheltenham Horse Racing festival, 12BET voided a large number of winning Cheltenham bets and closed the accounts of customers. 12BET argued that they had been subject to widespread bonus abuse by customers opening multiple accounts and claiming bonuses. However, after a furious response on social media, the bookie brand apologized and agreed to refund 75% of the affected customers. While ruling out a criminal investigation, the Isle of Man Constabulary continues to monitor allegations of withheld funds.
