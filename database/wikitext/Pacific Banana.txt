== Production ==
John Lamond had been impressed with the script for Alvin Purple (1973) and approached its original writer, Alan Hopgood with the idea of making a comedy about a broken down airline in the style of the Carry On films. Hopgood thought it was a good idea which could have led to a long-running series of comedies set in exotic locations around the world, with titles like Tokyo Banana and Guyana Banana. Lamond wanted to cast two English actors, Robin Stewart and Luan Peters, to give the movie more of a Carry On feel.The film was funded by the South Australian Film Corporation. According to Lamond, this led to the film being toned down when it should have been more like Alvin Purple.The movie was shot immediately before Nightmares (1980), also from Lamond, and edited at the same time. Filming took place in Norwood Studios, Adelaide, and Tahiti. Lamond later said he wished the island scenes had been shot in Queensland "because when you go overseas with a low budget, people want to stay in nice places and you can see the money going out the door. Just in overheads." But filming in Tahiti was a requirement of some of the investors. Lamond says the three-week shoot on the island was tough because the weather was hot and the location was isolated, making the cast and crew go stir crazy.Deborah Gray and Luan Peters wrote a theme song for fun during the shoot and Lamond liked it so much he decided to use it in the film.


== Reception ==
The film was not the commercial success everyone hoped. Alan Hogood felt the film departed from his original concept, becoming more slapstick orientated. Lamond believed he should have made the movie sexier. However it has since a developed a cult following.The South Australian Film Corporation is currently featuring the film on their website along with other films they funded in 1980.
