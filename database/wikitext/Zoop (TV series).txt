== Fan days ==
Zoop "fan days" were organised, where cast members would sign autographs. An average of 11,000 people showed up at each event. After several public appearances almost got out of hand (because the actors were overwhelmed by hundreds of fans), Nijenshuis announced in 2006 that the security details provided to the actors would be enlarged.
