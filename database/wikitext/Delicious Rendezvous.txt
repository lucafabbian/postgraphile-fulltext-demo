Delicious Rendezvous is a program that develops new menus using low demand local specialties to help farmers. Originally, the concept was to sell these menus at meeting places with large floating populations, such as rest areas, airports, and railway stations, to make them popular dishes, but this part of the concept was removed after it was noticed that these places simplified the recipes and sold unsatisfactory version of the dishes to the public, leading to negative comments. It was originally scheduled to be aired for only 12 episodes, but continued on for the first half of 2020 due to favorable reviews.
