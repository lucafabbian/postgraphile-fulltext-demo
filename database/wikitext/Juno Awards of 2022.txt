The Juno Awards of 2022 were held on May 15, 2022 in Toronto, Ontario. 
The awards were presented at the Budweiser Stage, an outdoor venue, and was hosted by actor Simu Liu.They were planned as an in-person gala ceremony, for the first time in three years due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada. This was the first time the ceremony had been held in Toronto since the Juno Awards of 2011 (they were scheduled to hold an in-person ceremony in 2021, but were unable to do so due to the COVID-19 pandemic).
