The Aero A.26 was a Czechoslovakian military reconnaissance biplane aircraft built by Aero Vodochody in the 1920s. It was Aero's last design to be based on the Hansa-Brandenburg B.I aircraft that the company had been building under licence during World War I as the Ae.10.
It first flew in 1923 and a small series was built. They were later used in the Czechoslovak civilian aviation.
