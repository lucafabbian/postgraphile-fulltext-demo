After finishing third at Hollywood Park Racetrack on his debut in a maiden race in April he finished unplaced in two similar events at the same track before winning a maiden at Delaware Park on August 15. He then finished fourth at Keystone Park and finished third in two allowance races at Keeneland in October.
