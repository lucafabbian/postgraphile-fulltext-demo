Justin ("Judo") Anlezark (born 14 August 1977 in Katherine, Northern Territory) is a male shot putter from Australia. His personal best throw is 20.96 metres, achieved in April 2003 in Brisbane.
Anlezark was the first Australian male to reach a World Championship Shot Put final in 2003, and his 4th-place finish remains the best ever performance by an Australian man in a throwing event at this level. He followed this up with a sixth-place finish at the 2004 Olympics, another best ever performance by an Australian in his event.
After the 2004 Olympics Anlezark had a few mediocre seasons, but after throwing 20.33 and 20.41 at the Loughborough International meet in 2008, selectors nominated Anlezark to the Australian Olympic Committee for selection in the team for the 2008 Summer Olympics. He joined Scott Martin making this the first Olympics since Melbourne in 1956 that Australia was represented by two male shotputters. Neither of them reached the final round.
