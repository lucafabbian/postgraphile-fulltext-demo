== History ==
The house, built c 1800, is the former home of Marie Francois Venus, a free Creole woman of color. The house was originally located in the small community of Grand Prairie. The house was constructed entirely of mortise and tenon construction. It features bousillage, a natural insulation that was once common in the walls of Cajun and Creole dwellings. It was usually made by mixing mud with spanish moss or animal hair and held into place by a series of wood bars (barreaux), set between the posts, which resulted into the walls.
