The 1983–84 NBA season was the 76ers' 35th season in the NBA and 21st season in Philadelphia. The 76ers entered the season as the defending NBA Champions, having won their third NBA Championship the year prior, sweeping the Los Angeles Lakers in four games. The team would start fast posting 21 wins in their first 26 games but finished with a 52–30 record. The major difference was that they were just around .500 on the road for the year, unlike the previous season, where they won 30 regular season games away from Philadelphia. The 76ers would lose in the first round of the newly expanded playoff format to the New Jersey Nets, who had never won a playoff series in their NBA history to that point. The 76ers lost all three post season games at The Spectrum.
