== Reception ==
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states "This intriguing double LP was innovative composer George Russell's first recording after breaking up his young combo of the early '60s... Most unusual is a suite dedicated to Russell's Lydian concept that includes abstract versions of "Bags' Groove," "Confirmation" and "'Round Midnight".
