John Pullar (22 April 1803 – 16 December  1878) was a 19th-century Scottish businessman, and founder of J. Pullar and Sons (later J & J Pullar Ltd and Pullars of Perth). He went into local politics in later life, becoming Provost of Perth. He was the patriarch of the Pullar dynasty which spawned a number of notable figures in Scottish history.


== Life ==
Pullar was born on 22 April 1803 at Pomarium in Perth, the son of Robert Pullar (1782–1835), a cloth manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Black (died 1857).

In 1824 he set up his own dyeworks at Burt's Close in Perth with six employees. His premises dyed cloth for his father and provided dyeing and laundry services for the public. In 1828 he relocated to 36 Mill Street to distance himself from neighbours and have an area of expansion with good water supply. The firm benefitted from the arrival of trains in 1847. In 1851 they exhibited at the Great Exhibition in London and received the patronage of Queen Victoria
in 1852, thereafter being by appointment to the Queen.By 1856 they employed over 100 persons and had over thirty premises gathering clothes for cleaning.
In 1865 the Mill Street premises was rebuilt and renamed the North British Dyeworks. The building remains and is now known as "Pullar House" and houses Perth and Kinross Council.In 1867/8 Pullars began dry cleaning (the first dry cleaning service in Scotland) due to his son James marriage to Adelgunde Spindler, daughter of Wilhelm Spindler who invented the benzene method of dry cleaning. John (already 63 years old) left this element of the business wholly in the hands of James. Robert Pringle handled the remainder of the business whilst John took a new role as Provost of Perth, serving (as a radical Liberal) 1867 to 1873.During his time as Provost he brought improvements to the railway system and various city improvement schemes. He was concurrently a Director of the Bank of Scotland, Director of the Caledonian Railway Company and Trustee and Director of Perth Royal Infirmary. He was a Deacon of the Perth Baptist Church and an advocate of the temperance movement.

In August 1826 Pullar married Mary Walker (1805–1891) of Brahan in Ross-shire.
Their nine children included four famous sons: Sir Robert Pullar, James Pullar, Edmund Pullar and Laurence Pullar. He was grandfather to Frederick Pullar
