The MAS1 oncogene (MAS receptor) is a G protein-coupled receptor which binds the angiotensin II metabolite angiotensin (1-7). The MAS1 receptor, when activated by binding angiotensin-(1-7), opposes many of the effects of the angiotensin II receptor. Hence, MAS1 receptor agonists have similar therapeutic effects to angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including lowering of blood pressure.
