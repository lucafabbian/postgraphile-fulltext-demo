Days of Kaunas City (Lithuanian: Kauno miesto dienos) is an annual series of cultural events to celebrate the anniversary of Kaunas, Lithuania. The festivities mark May 20, 1463, when Grand Duke Casimir IV Jagiellon renewed and expanded the privileges of the city in 1463. The oldest original privilege is kept in Saint Petersburg archives and its copy is kept in the Town Hall of Kaunas. The main events of the festival, including folk art fairs and concerts, take place in the streets and squares of the Old Town of Kaunas at the end of May.
