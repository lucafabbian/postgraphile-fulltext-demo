Oklahoma's 4th congressional district is located in south-central Oklahoma and covers (in whole or in part) a total of 15 counties. Its principal cities include Midwest City, Norman, Moore, Ada, Duncan, Lawton/Ft. Sill, and Ardmore.  The district also includes much of southern Oklahoma City.
The district is currently represented by Republican Tom Cole.


== Geography ==
The district borders Texas along the Red River to the south. To the north, the district includes a very small square-shaped portion of south-central Oklahoma County (enough to capture the city of Midwest City) and then Cleveland, McClain, Grady, Garvin, Murray, Pontotoc, Comanche, Tillman, Cotton, Stephens, Jefferson, Carter,  and Love counties.


== History ==
As with the rest of the state, the district gives GOP candidates wide margins - George W. Bush received 61 percent of the vote in 2000, 67% in 2004, and John McCain received 66% of the vote in 2008. Mitt Romney received 67% in 2012, and Donald Trump received 66% and 65% in 2016 and 2020, respectively. The district is 63 percent urban, 5 percent Latino, and 3.5 percent foreign-born.
