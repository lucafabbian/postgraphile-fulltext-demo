St Michael and All Angels’ Church, Hathersage, is a Grade I listed parish church in the Church of England in Hathersage, Derbyshire.


== History ==

The church dates from the 14th century. It was restored between 1851 and 1852 by William Butterfield and reopened on 15 April 1852. The whitewash on the walls was removed and the outer pillars and buttresses were renewed. The church was re-pewed with open seats. A new stained-glass window by William Wailes of Newcastle was inserted at the east end of the chancel. There is a stained-glass window by Charles Kempe, which was removed from Derwent Chapel before it was submerged under the Ladybower Reservoir. The church was tiled with Minton encaustic tiles. The total cost of the restoration was £1,575 (equivalent to £180,000 in 2021).There were some further extensions added in 1949.


== Tomb of Little John ==

Stones in the churchyard mark what is claimed to be the grave of Little John, where in 1780 James Shuttleworth claims to have unearthed a thigh bone measuring 72.39 centimetres (28.50 in). This would have made Little John 8.08 feet (2.46 m) in height.
