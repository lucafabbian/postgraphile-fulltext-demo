The Welsh Presbyterian Church is in St John Street, Chester, Cheshire, England.  The church was built in 1866, and designed by W. & G. Audsley of Liverpool.  It is constructed with a yellow sandstone front, brick sides and rear, and a slate roof.  The plan consists of a simple rectangle, with an apse at the east end, and a narrower single-storey narthex at the west (entrance) end.  The narthex is supported by octagonal piers at the corners and two granite columns between them.  On each side of the narthex is a lancet window.  Above the narthex is a large rose window, with a lancet window above, and a cross finial on the gable.  The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building.  The wall and the iron railings and gates in front of the church are included in the listing.
