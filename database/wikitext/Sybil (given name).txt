Sybil or Sibyl is a feminine given name of Greek origin given in reference to the sibyls, oracles of Ancient Greece. It has been in common use in Christian countries since the Middle Ages. Latinate forms of the name in use by 1381 included Sibilla and Sibilia. It was thought suitable as a name for girls by Christians, despite its pagan origins, because the sibyls had delivered messages from a deity and were thought to have been blessed by God with partial understanding of the coming of Jesus Christ.  It became more common in the 1800s. Usage of the name recently increased due to a character on the popular TV series Downton Abbey.   Sibylle, a French version of the name, is considered a bon chic bon genre name more likely to be given to girls from upper class French families.
