== History ==

Cummersdale station was opened by the Maryport & Carlisle Railway in 1858. At grouping in 1923 the M&CR became a part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway.  It was one of several lightly used intermediate stations on this section of the route to be closed by the British Transport Commission (in 1951) in the years immediately after the nationalisation of the UK rail network. The station was served by workmens trains until the early 1960s. The main Carlisle-Maryport line (completed in 1845) remains open and forms part of the Cumbrian Coast Line between Carlisle and Barrow in Furness. 
The station had two through platforms. It lay close to a dye works and overlooked Carlisle racecourse.
George Stephenson was the engineer for the Maryport and Carlisle Railway and his one major engineering structure was the 57-metre-long, three span Cummersdale viaduct which spans the River Caldew at a 52Â° skew two miles south of Carlisle. This viaduct was the most significant structure on the railway which was opened as a single line, the current twin track viaduct structure was a 1910 upgrade. This bridge was rebuilt in 2012.
