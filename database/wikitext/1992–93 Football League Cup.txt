The 1992–93 Football League Cup (known as the Coca-Cola Cup for sponsorship reasons) was the 33rd Football League Cup, a knockout competition for England's top 92 football clubs. The competition name reflects a sponsorship deal with soft drink brand Coca-Cola.
Arsenal won the competition, beating Sheffield Wednesday 2–1 in the final.


== First round ==
56 of the First, Second and Third Division clubs compete from the First Round. Each section is divided equally into a pot of seeded clubs and a pot of unseeded clubs. Clubs' rankings depend upon their finishing position in the 1991–92 season. Reading received a bye to the second round of the competition, as they had been drawn to play Maidstone United, who resigned from the Football League on 17 August due to financial problems.
