== Background ==
"In Vain" is a power ballad song written for the band's seventh studio album Resist. The track features a "down-to-earth" production and uses "softer rock stylings" and "emotionally driven lyrics" in order to achieve the new direction the band aimed for the record. The song was released as the fourth single from the album and accompanied a lyric video. Differently from the previous singles, which were all played live before the album official release, the track only started being played on tour afterwards. Despite not entering any official single sales chart, the song found airplay rotation in selected places and managed to enter airplay charts in Belgium, Czech Republic and Finland, where it stayed for ten weeks.
