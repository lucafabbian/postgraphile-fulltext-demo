== History ==
The museum was opened in 1940, founded by Charles Knox Smith (1845â€“1916), an oil and mining businessman, in his will. Smith was born in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia and began his career as a grocer's boy and as an oil wagon driver.  He rose to become a partner in that oil firm and subsequently invested in his own oil brokerage and a gold and silver mining company in Mexico.
Smith's collection of paintings, sculpture and antiques form the base of the permanent collection.  It is housed in his Victorian mansion, Woodmere, to which Smith had added large exhibition spaces.
