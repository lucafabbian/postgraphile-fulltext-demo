Frans Kannik (24 July 1949 – 28 July 2011) was educated in Serigraph (screen printing) in 1968. He also studied calligraphy in Oslo between 1971 and 1974. As an artist, he was generally self-educated.  He was a multifaceted artist that expressed in a wide range of paintings, graphics, installation art, performance arts and sculptures.
The fact that Frans Kannik was also a sculptor may be difficult for future generations to recognize. He made numerous sculptures in plastic, gypsum, cement, foamrubber and the like, but all the sculptures and materials from the installations were destroyed after the end of the exhibition.


== The early artist years ==
Beginning in 1980, Frans Kannik quickly became an important figure in the Danish art scene. He was one of the founders of the artistic workshop cooperative Leifsgade 22 at Islands Brygge in Copenhagen, which had a central role in the 1980s neo-expressionistic development. The main part of his work was figurative painting with the naked human form at the dominant motif. The human body is painted in a classic, idealistic shape with movement as the principal theme. He often did not paint on traditional canvases but used an assemblage of materials such as blankets, linens, corrugated cardboard, plastic, vinyl etc.
In the later years, Frans Kannik worked alone with his artwork and models in his studio at Frederiksberg.
