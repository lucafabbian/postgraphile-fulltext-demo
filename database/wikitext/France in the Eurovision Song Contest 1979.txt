=== Internal selection ===
The French national final to select their entry, Concours de la Chanson Française pour l'Eurovision 1979, was to be held on 4 March 1979 at the TF1 Studios in Paris, but the Société Française de Production, the French film technicians' union, went on strike, barring the semi-finals from airing and the finals from being taped at all. A professional jury picked the winner out of a pool of 14 semi-finalists.
The winning entry was "Je suis l'enfant soleil", performed by Anne Marie David and composed by Eddy Marnay with lyrics by Hubert Giraud. Despite the strike, Anne Marie David's semi-final performance was allowed to be shown during Preview Week.
