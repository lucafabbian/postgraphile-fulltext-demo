Richelle and Raf narrate on a videotape the history of her family. Don Luis Go is a Chinese immigrant who married a Filipina named Elisa. In 1949, the young Luis brought Elisa to China. There Elisa suffered discrimination and misunderstanding from Luis' parents. She decides to go back to the Philippines and Luis joins her. Luis became a cook and Elisa a laundrywoman. Their hard work pays off and they become one of the most prominent Chinese businessmen in the country. The film then shows the challenges they face in old age set simultaneously with the struggles faced by their children and grandchildren in adulthood.
In the present day, the elderly Gos celebrate their wedding anniversary when they are interrupted by their granddaughter Richelle, a delinquent who scandalizes them by wearing revealing clothes, bringing her disreputable boyfriend as a guest and giving them a porn video as a present. Richelle is later arrested on drug charges by authorities led by Raf, who convinces Richelle to turn witness in return for withholding the news of her arrest from her family. Richelle is scorned by the family after she names a family friend as a major drug dealer and her delayed arrival at Elisa's deathbed. Later, Richelle and her sister Juliet are abducted and her other sister Vera's fiancé Emerson  is killed. Raf, who develops a romantic relationship with Richelle, rescues her, but Richelle is shot while shielding Juliet and nearly dies.
