A 5-year-old girl named Franny visits with Grandpa every day at his shoe repair shop in Vancouver, Canada. They talk about all matters until a customer comes. The customer presents shoes needing to be repaired to Grandpa, who gives them to Franny to place inside the shoe repair box. Franny tries on the footwear and they take Franny to a magical place such as a Native American magic world in Wyoming, a sunny beach in Jamaica, or a high mountain in China. At the end of each episode, after Franny solves the problem in a magical place, she receives a treasure and adds it to a treasure box and solves an imaginative problem.
