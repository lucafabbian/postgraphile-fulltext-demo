The Mercedes-Benz M103 is a straight-6 15 degrees, crossflow cylinder head with an inclination to the right, automobile engine produced from 1984 to 1997. It is a single overhead cam design with 2 valves per cylinder. The M103 was replaced by the M104 starting in 1989. The bore spacing on the M103 engine is 97 mm. This engine received several updates over the years of production, one of the updates was a change from a spherical combustion chamber to a "heart shaped" combustion chamber.

Bore and stroke: 82.9 mm × 80.2 mm (3.26 in × 3.16 in)
Compression ratio: 9.2:1
Redline: 6200 rpm
Firing order: 1-5-3-6-2-4
Lubrication system: pressure circulation
Oil capacity: 6 litres (1.6 US gal; 1.3 imp gal)
Coolant capacity: 8.5 litres (2.2 US gal; 1.9 imp gal)

Number of valves: 1 intake, 1 exhaust with V-shaped overhead configuration
Valve operation: 1 top camshaft
Starter motor: 1.5 kW electrical motor; since Jan 1988: 1.7 kW
Ignition system: electronic ignition system.The only mechanical differences from the M103 3.0 L to the M103 2.6 L were the smaller bore and intake valves, with a slightly different airbox. The CIS-E components between 2.6 and 3.0 variants are all shared for any given model year with the exception of the ECU making engine swaps from 2.6 to 3.0 virtually bolt-in.
This engine can be found in the W201 (190E 2.6), W124 (260E / 300E 2.6) and W126 (260SE).
