Lance "Un" Rivera is an American film director, film producer, screenwriter, record producer, and music executive.


== Career ==
Lance Rivera began his music career when he met a neighborhood rapper named Christopher Wallace, who rhymed under the name, The Notorious B.I.G. After hearing him perform, Rivera offered to finance his musical career.


=== Undeas Recordings and Untertainment ===
In 1994, when Undeas Recordings was created in partnership with co-owner The Notorious BIG and Atlantic Records, Rivera was put in charge of its roster, which included The Notorious B.I.G.'s protégé group Junior M.A.F.I.A., including its core member, Lil' Kim. Junior M.A.F.I.A. released only one album under Undeas/Atlantic, 1995's Conspiracy, which went gold in under a month and sustained two singles: "Player's Anthem" and "Get Money"; both of which gained way for Lil' Kim's breakout solo career. That following year, on November 12, 1996, Undeas released Kim's debut solo album, Hard Core, which included the singles, "No Time", "Crush on You" and "Not Tonight". All of which became top-ten Billboard hits and helped the album reached the top fifteen of the Billboard 200 at number eleven.
In 1997,  Rivera launched another label called Untertainment Records. The label's roster included Harlem rapper Cam'ron and Philadelphia rappers Dutch and Spade of Major Figgas and Charli Baltimore; Cam'ron and Charli Baltimore were signed through Epic Records while Dutch and Spade were signed to Interscope Records. The label's first release was the soundtrack to the 1998 comedy film, Woo. Only Cam'ron released two albums under that label: 1998's Confessions of Fire and 2000's S.D.E.. In July 1999, Junior M.A.F.I.A. member Lil' Cease released a solo album under Undeas, The Wonderful World of Cease A Leo. Eventually, vice versa, fellow Junior M.A.F.I.A. affiliate Lil' Kim released her sophomore solo album, The Notorious K.I.M., almost a year later in June 2000 (also under Undeas). Despite the Notorious K.I.M. being the final album released under Undeas and it going platinum in under two months, Rivera was in no way involved in this project. After losing Untertainment artist Charli Baltimore, Rivera attempted a comeback in the music business with the release of Major Figgas' Dutch and Spade's collaborative single, "If You Want It". However, after the single failed to chart, the duo's album, For My Family, originally planned for a November 2001 release, was shelved.
