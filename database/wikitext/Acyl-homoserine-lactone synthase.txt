Acyl-homoserine-lactone synthase (EC 2.3.1.184) is an enzyme with systematic name acyl-(acyl-carrier protein):S-adenosyl-L-methionine acyltranserase (lactone-forming, methylthioadenosine-releasing). This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

acyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + S-adenosyl-L-methionine

   [acyl-carrier protein] + S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine + N-acyl-L-homoserine lactoneAcyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) are produced by a number of bacterial species and are used by them to regulate the expression of virulence genes in a process known as quorum-sensing.
