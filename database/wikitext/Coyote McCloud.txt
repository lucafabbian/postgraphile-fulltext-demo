Early in his career, he was an afternoon drive personality at WGOW-AM (owned by Ted Turner) in Chattanooga, using the name Bill Scott. In 1976, his recording of "Nitty Gritty Rock and Roll" was released as 45 rpm record on the Midland South label, distributed by RCA. The song included the catch-phrases he used as a nighttime deejay on WQXI "Quixie" in Atlanta.
While hosting the morning show at Kix 104 (WWKX) in 1983, McCloud was selected by Country Music Television network cofounders Glenn D. Daniels and G. Dean Daniels to be the first on-air voice of the network. When CMT (originally called "CMTV") launched on March 5, 1983, McCloud provided the first vocal announcement heard on the network under an animated "CMTV" logo with the words, “You're Watching CMTV...Country Music Television...in stereo." He remained the on-air voice of the network from 1983 through 1984.
McCloud also worked at Power Country 103 (WZPC) in the mid-1990s and Oldies 96.3 (WMAK) in the early 2000s. Along with Cathy Martindale, he hosted Coyote & Cathy In The Morning on 96.3 (WMAK FM) and 97.1 WRQQ until late November 2006.
