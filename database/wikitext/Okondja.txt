== Geography and geology ==
By road, Okondja is located 156 kilometres (97 mi) northeast of Franceville. It lies on the Sébé River and is located in the Sébé Valley. It lies along National Route 15 and is served by Okondja Airport.Geologically it belongs to the Okondja Basin, a forested area with submarine "spilitic volcanism", which explains its significant manganese reserves. A Chinese-Brazilian consortium is keen on exploiting local reserves of manganese, and there is a known manganese ore mine  about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) to the east and numerous others in the area. By 2004, the Brazilians had shown an interest in exploiting at least two deposits in the Okondja area. A 2006 assessment of the area concluded that if exploited to its full potential, Gabon could become the leading exporter of manganese in the world, if the deposits at Franceville, Mbigou and Ndjolé are also exploited. Okondja is also said to have a high diversity of unusual cultivars and bananas and coffee are produced in the area.
