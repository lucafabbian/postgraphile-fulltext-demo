Handball at the Friendship Games is the handball tournament organized for the 1984 Summer Olympics boycotting countries. Given that the Eastern Bloc countries and allies were at that time amongst the most competitive teams the tournament's level was rather high.
It was contested in two events. Men's event took place in Rostock and Magdeburg, East Germany between 17 and 21 July 1984, with eight teams competing. The women's event was contested at Hala na Sihoti in Trenčín, Czechoslovakia between 21 and 25 August 1984, with six teams competing.
