Jean-Louis Fage (30 September 1883, in Limoges – 1964, in Dijon) was a French marine biologist and arachnologist.
A native of Limoges, he studied biology at the Sorbonne and in the laboratory at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. In 1906 he obtained his doctorate with a thesis on the nephridia of polychaetes. For the next fourteen years he served as a naturalist at the Laboratoire de biologie marine in Banyuls-sur-Mer. From 1920 he worked in the zoology department at the Muséum national d'histoire naturelle in Paris, where in 1938 he succeeded Charles Joseph Gravier (1865–1937) as professor and director of the department of zoology (worms and crustaceans).
Fage made contributions in the fields of carcinology (study of crustaceans), arachnology and speleology. In 1945 he was a founding member of the Commission de spéléologie (being part of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique – CNRS). He also performed research of Ellobiopsis (genus of parasitic protozoa). A genus of ammonites named Fagesia is named after him.
