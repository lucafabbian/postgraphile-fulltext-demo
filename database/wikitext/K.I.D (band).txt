== History ==
In high school, singer Kara Lane from Washington and friend Chris Rabba from Toronto enjoyed smoking cigarettes during class hours. Lane and Rabba turned their relationship into ideas around cravings and desires.  They traveled to the city to perform at "Elvis Mondays", an open mic night for Toronto bands and also performed at Mediterranean restaurants. Then, Kara appeared as the band's front woman because of her vocal range and stage presence. Bobby finds his voice as a lyricist and began drafting songs about sexual frustration, acne, nihilism and his struggle with clinical depression.
K.I.D searched for a producer to help them craft a garage-style album that can resonate with a generation in search of non-traditional bands. As a result,  the band meets with Mike Crossey, producer of  The 1975, Wolf Alice,  Arctic Monkeys and Foals infamy. The producer liked the song "I Wish I Was Your Cigarette" and met K.I.D at a show in London to express his interest.  The band released in 2015, their new single "Errors", as a follow-up to their indie hit "I Wish I Was Your Cigarette."
