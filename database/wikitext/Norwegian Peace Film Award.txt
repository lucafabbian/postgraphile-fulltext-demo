The Norwegian Peace Film Award - NoPFA was founded December 2, 2003. The organizations represented at the inaugural meeting were the Centre for Peace Studies (CPS), the Students Network for Peace (SNF), and the Tromsø International Film Festival (TIFF).


== Objectives ==
The NoPFA-Foundation will annually give The Norwegian Peace Film Award during the Tromsø International Film Festival to a film spotlighting direct, structural or cultural violence, and which in a creative way contributes to a deeper understanding of conflicts and violence. Through educational work and distribution of the award, the foundation wants to contribute to the promotion of a culture of peace both on local and international level.
The foundation is a non-profit organization and has no political affiliation.


== Organization ==
The foundation is managed by a board consisting of six members. Each of the three founding organizations appoints two members. The board is responsible for the administration of the foundation, for its representation outwards, for the nomination of relevant films for the award, and for the appointment of the jury.
