Class S12 is a diesel multiple-unit (DMU), built for Sri Lanka Railways by China's CSR Corporation. The first batch arrived in Sri Lanka in August 2012.  They were built to replace locomotive-hauled passenger trains.  Seven of the S12 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long-distance travel on the Main line from Colombo to Badulla.  Four of S12s will serve the Kelani Valley Line.  The remaining two designed as luxury trains.


== History ==
The S12 DMUs were meant to improve services on the Main Line and the Kelani Valley Line.  The steep slopes on the up-country portion of the Main Line is difficult to operate.  Prior to the S12, only a few models of locomotives were capable of operating this line.  As DMUs started to replace locomotive-operated trains on other lines, the up-country Main Line could not be operated by DMUs.  The S12 is the first DMU to handle these conditions.
The locomotives are purchased under a USD 101 million credit line agreement with China.  The loan would be settled within 15 years.In September 2012, the first units had trial runs.  The first Main-Line train using the S12 began on 23 October 2012.
