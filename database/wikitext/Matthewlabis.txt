Matthewlabis is an extinct genus of camelid endemic to North America. It lived in the Early Oligocene 33.3â€”30.8 mya, existing for approximately 2 million years. Fossils have been found only in Wyoming and eastern Nebraska. It was previously named Paralabis, but this name had been previously used for a genus of earwig, so the name was changed in 2011.
