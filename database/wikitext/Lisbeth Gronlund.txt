== Recognition ==
In 2001, Gronlund was named a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), after a nomination from the APS Forum on Physics and Society, "in recognition of her many important contributions to arms control, including work on missile defense, missile capabilities and the nuclear fuel cycle as it relates to proliferation, made possible by her ability to analyze technical issues and by her community". She was elected as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2007.Gronlund was also one of the 2001 winners of the Joseph A. Burton Forum Award of the APS, "for creative and sustained leadership in building an international arms-control-physics community and for their own excellence in arms-control physics". She shared the award with George N. Lewis and David C. Wright, of the MIT Security Studies Program and Union of Concerned Scientists respectively.
