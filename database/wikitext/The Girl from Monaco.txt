The Girl from Monaco (original title: La Fille de Monaco) is a 2008 French comedy-drama film directed by Anne Fontaine. The film stars Fabrice Luchini, Roschdy Zem, Louise Bourgoin, and Stéphane Audran.


== Plot ==
Middle-aged and highly successful lawyer Bertrand Beauvois (Fabrice Luchini) is hired by Monaco businessman Louis Lassalle (Gilles Cohen) to defend his mother Édith Lassalle (Stéphane Audran), who has killed her former lover. Lassalle assigns a bodyguard to Beauvois, Christophe Abadi (Roschdy Zem).
Audrey Varella (Louise Bourgoin), a beautiful but highly promiscuous local TV weather girl whose previous lovers include Christophe, enamors Beauvois, hoping to make a better life with him. This despite the warnings of Christophe to Beauvois, who have formed a bond of friendship, to stay away from her.
Audrey spends all her time with Beauvois, including nights of exhausting wild sex, and Beauvois entreats Christophe to make her disappear from his life. He then continues to the court for his final plead in the Lassalle case.
After having sex with her, Christophe pushes Audrey and her scooter off the road and kills her. Beauvois willingly takes the blame. In one of the last scenes, we see Mrs. Lassalle being freed from prison after only one year of imprisonment while Beauvois remains among the inmates.
