Count Robert Henrik Rehbinder (15 July 1777 – 8 March 1841) served as the Secretary of State for the Grand Duchy of Finland between 1811 and 1841. One of the highest officials in the Grand Duchy, he played a significant part in establishing the autonomous role of Finland at the Diet of Porvoo in 1809.

Born in Paimio, Rehbinder was given the title count in 1826, and in 1834 he was given the title Privy Counsellor. He was also awarded with the second highest Russian honor and given an honorary doctorship in philosophy at the University of Helsinki in 1840, at the 200 year jubilee of the University (originally Royal Academy of Turku).

Three streets in Helsinki have been named after him: Stora Robertsgatan (Iso Roobertinkatu) in Punavuori, Lilla Robertsgatan (Pieni Roobertinkatu) in Kaartinkaupunki and Rehbindersvägen (Rehbinderintie) in Eira. Furthermore, the current southern part of the Mannerheimintie street was until 1942 named after him (Heikinkatu or Henriksgatan in Swedish). He was portrayed on a stamp in Finland in 1936.
