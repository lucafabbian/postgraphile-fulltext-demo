== Azadi Stadium attendance ==
In January 2022, Pashaei watched the match between Persepolis and Traktorsazi teams at Azadi Stadium. The presence of women in Iranian stadiums has limitations. After watching the match, she told reporters:
"This is the first time a female representative has attended Azadi Stadium, and it is a very good experience. I was also very proud to see the female reporters. We have to make the entrance of female spectators to the stadium because we live in a global village and we can not move against the flow of water."
She added: "We can provide special places for women and it is a pity that not everyone enjoys it. It was not for me to be in the stadium because there is no place in the stadium where I can come to the stadium more easily, but the officials have to provide the conditions for all the athletes to be in the stadium."
