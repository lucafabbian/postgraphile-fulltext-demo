Houston Executive Airport (ICAO: KTME, FAA LID: TME, formerly 78T) is a public-use airport in unincorporated Waller County, Texas, United States. The airport is located 28 nautical miles (52 km) west of Downtown Houston and it is in proximity to Brookshire. The airport is privately owned by WCF, LLC, which is based in Waller County.


== History ==

The airport, which opened in January 2007, was funded by Ron Henriksen, an area businessman and pilot. Henriksen said that the airport's business plan caters to businesses based in the Energy Corridor area of Houston. Andrew Perry, the airport's executive director, said in February 2007 that the airport could compete with Sugar Land Regional Airport in Sugar Land, Texas, and that the airport's proximity to Interstate 10 and Energy Corridor businesses were the airport's greatest advantages. Lance LaCour, the council president and chief executive officer of the Katy Area Economic Development Council, said that the group intended to promote and help increase business at the airport since the group believed that the airport could help the council attract new industries to its area and retain existing industries in its area. By June 2007, the airport has around 50 flight operations per working week and up to 80 flight operations per weekend block. Alan Clark, the transportation planning director for regional planning group Houston-Galveston Area Council, said that the data suggests that leisure travelers use the airport more often than corporate travel.By June 2007, the airport started construction on a 48,000-square-foot (4,500 m2) service center. The center, scheduled to open in 2008, has a business center, a crew lounge, a 26,000-square-foot (2,400 m2) hangar, a weather briefing room, and other facilities.In 2011, Ron Henriksen opened Austin Executive Airport, located approximately 93 miles (150 km) northwest of Houston Executive Airport. The terminal buildings of both airports intentionally share very similar design stylings and amenities.
