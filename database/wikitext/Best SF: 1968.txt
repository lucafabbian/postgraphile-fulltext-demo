== Reception ==
In 1969, Publishers' Weekly's Barbara A. Bannon called it "a must for SF readers." In its paperback edition, Publishers' Weekly's Leonore Fleischer opined "We find it difficult to keep up with all the annual anthologies of science-fiction claiming "best" in their titles. So we'll just tell you that this one contains the usual number of impressive names." Cosmos: A Science-Fantasy Review's Geoffrey Giles wrote "At today's rising prices, considering you are getting the cream of the year's crop gathered from all sides, these 207 pages are excellent value for money—probably the best buy on the market." Analog Science Fiction / Science Fact's P. Schuyler Miller appraised it as "down a notch in my estimation from last year's. I think it's the effect of the "New Wave," which finds virtue in incoherence for confusion's sake." In 1970, The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction's Joanna Russ said Best SF: 1968 was "a fair mixed bag of stories framed by an Introduction and Afterword that indirectly—and unfortunately—lead one to expect more from the stories than they manage to give."
