AllMusic reviewer David Jeffries wrote that "If you haven't figured it out from the album's title, the song titles, or even the band's name, The Green Album is a pro-weed album from aging cottage industry insiders known as the Kottonmouth Kings. [...] [The album] finds them a bit more out of touch with what's happening in the rest of the music world".
