The Black and White Café was a café in St Pauls, Bristol, in the United Kingdom, that opened in 1971, owned by the Wilks family. The Caribbean food café had a reputation as a drug den and was raided more times by the police than any other premises in the country.
Events during a 1980 police raid on the café were a catalyst for the St Pauls riot. The café remained a centre for drug dealing and violent turf wars through the 1990s, with a peak in the early 2000s, and raids also revealed weapons and illegal immigrants. The Observer dubbed the café "Britain's most dangerous hard drug den".The café closed in 2004 under legal action as a result of new anti-social behaviour legislation and was later demolished.
