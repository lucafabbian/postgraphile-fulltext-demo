Sorry, Little Sarah is the first single from the Blue System's debut album, Walking On A Rainbow. It was published in 1987 by Hanseatic M.V. and was distributed by BMG. The lyrics, music, arrangements and production was made by Dieter Bohlen, and the co-production by Luis Rodríguez. This song has a strong bossa nova influence.
What Dieter Bohlen has said about this song, "After Modern Talking, I thought for a long time what I could do now, and we never had a Samba hit in Germany. So it was, for me, a big challenge to write a Samba title."
