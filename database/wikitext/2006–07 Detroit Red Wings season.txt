The 2006–07 Detroit Red Wings season was the 81st National Hockey League season in Detroit, Michigan. The Wings entered a new era, following the retirement of longtime captain Steve Yzerman after 22 seasons (23 years) in the NHL, all spent with Detroit.  The Wings named Yzerman a team vice-president, Yzerman's number 19 was retired by the Wings in January.The Red Wings lost another longtime player in Brendan Shanahan, who signed with the New York Rangers, although they retained the services of goaltender Dominik Hasek, who re-signed with the club as a free agent. Hasek remained one of the NHL's goaltending leaders, helping the Red Wings remain in contention for top spot in the Western Conference, battling with their division rivals, the Nashville Predators.
Two Red Wings players represented the West at the 2007 All-Star Game in Dallas, Texas – Nicklas Lidstrom was elected as a starting defenceman, and registered an assist, where he was joined by forward Henrik Zetterberg.
