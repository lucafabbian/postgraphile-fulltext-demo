== Production ==
This particular comedy film was shot twice. The negative for the first version of The Red Widow burned up in a nitrate fire before the distribution prints could be made. This was probably the same Famous Players fire of September 11, 1915, that destroyed the first version of Mary Pickford's Esmeralda (1915). Barrymore and the cast reshot the film for no salary.
