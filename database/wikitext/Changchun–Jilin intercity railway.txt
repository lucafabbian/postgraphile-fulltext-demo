Changchun–Jilin intercity railway (simplified Chinese: 长吉城际铁路; traditional Chinese: 長吉城際鐵路; pinyin: Cháng-Jí Chéngjì Tiělù) is a high-speed rail line operated by China Railway High-speed in Jilin Province, which opened for service on January 11, 2011. It is the first intercity high-speed rail to be operational in Northeast China. Like the Shanghai–Nanjing intercity high-speed railway, which services Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport, the Changchun–Jilin intercity railway serves as an airport rail link for the cities of Changchun and Jilin.


== Summary ==
The line connects, and terminates at, the cities of Changchun and Jilin. The entire line spans 111 km (69 mi) and was built at a cost of RMB 9.6 billion. Construction began on May 13, 2007, and the line was officially open to the public on January 11, 2011. The operational speed of the network is 250 km/h (160 mph), which means that travel between the two cities now takes about 29 minutes, down from the previous 1.5 hours.
