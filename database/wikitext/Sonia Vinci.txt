Sonia Vinci (born 1971) is a former journalist and co-anchor of Nine News in Perth.
She began a journalist in 1990 at Perth radio 6PR and later became Australia's youngest female news director. During her time at 6PR, Sonia also worked at Channel Seven Perth as a weekend journalist for Seven News, and also read sports news for Seven's Footy Show in 1994.
She later worked for regional station GWN as a news anchor before returning to 6PR and the Channel 9 in 2000. She worked initially as a stand-by news anchor, but later became weeknight anchor, and with Dixie Marshall was part of Australia's first female duo news team from 2003â€“2007.
In January 2008, Nine announced that Vinci would host a new Western Australian version of A Current Affair. However, it was announced in July that Vinci would not proceed with her new position, with a view to "spending more time with the kids".
