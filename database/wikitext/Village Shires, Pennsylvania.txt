== Community association ==
Almost every residence in the census designation of Village Shires is part of the Village Shires Community Association.  Village Shires is governed by a 7-member community board of directors.  The board of directors sets and approves the budget, hires the on-site management, hires the in-house landscaping crew, purchases equipment, contracts with vendors to maintain recreational facilities and community maintenance, and sets community rules and regulations.  The on-site management offices are located at 3001 East Village Road.
Village Shires is managed by the Village Shires Community Association (VSCA).  The VSCA includes single homes - Heather Valley I and II; townhouses - Country Place I and II, Bridleridge, Natura, and Millpond; and six independent condominium associations, Beacon Hill, Signal Hill/Heritage Place, Tamerlane, Canterbury Croft, Hamlet, and Old Jordan Woods.
In an attempt to facilitate economies of operation, the six condominium associations annually contract with the VSCA to perform combined community services. The VSCA oversees landscaping, snow removal, maintenance, and operation of recreational and common areas through supervisory and contractual agreements with the Danella Management and Realty Co. Inc., an on-site management company.
Community-wide elections are held every November to fill vacant positions on the VSCA Executive Board for the ensuing calendar year.  In an effort to ensure continuity of operations, board positions overlap and span two year terms.  There are also several committees that report to the executive board, such as the Architectural Control Committee, which assists the executive board in approving or denying requests to make additions and alterations to townhomes by owners.
The Board of Directors meets monthly with the on-site manager to discuss and supervise finances, community matters, correspondence, contractual agreements, vendor and contractor performance, budgetary matters and any other issues pertinent to the community.
