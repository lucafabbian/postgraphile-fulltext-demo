Director musices, Latin for music director, was a title held by music directors especially at European universities or cathedrals; sometimes also at cathedral schools. The title is still used at universities in Sweden. In Finland it is an honorary award granted by the President of the Republic. 
Today directores musices are primarily responsible for music activities at a university and choral and/or orchestra conductors.
