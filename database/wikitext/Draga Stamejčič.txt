Draga Stamejčič (Slovene: Драга Стамејчић, 27 February 1937 – August 2015) was a Slovenian athlete who competed at the 1960 and 1964 Olympics. In 1960 she was eliminated in the heats of the 80 m hurdles event. Two weeks before the 1964 Games she set a world record in the hurdles, but at the Olympics finished only seventh due to a knee injury. She also finished fifth in the pentathlon. The knee injury required an extensive operation and resulted in her retirement around mid-1960s. She married, gave birth to twins and devoted herself to the family. In 2012, she was inducted into the Slovenian Athletes Hall of Fame.
