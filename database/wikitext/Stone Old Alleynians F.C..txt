The club started in Division 4 of the Stafford Amateur League, gaining promotion to Division 3 in their second season. The following season saw them promoted again and further promotion followed as they finished as champions of Division 2. The 1970–71 season saw the club win the league for the first time, and then winning it again a further 3 times.The club joined the North Staffs Alliance League for the start of the 1980–81 season. When the league was split into two, the club was essentially relegated to Division one, they  came back to the Premier division as runners-up at the end of the 1987–88 season. In 1992 the team moved to the Staffordshire County League. The 2007–08 season saw the club move to Division 2 of the West Midlands (Regional) League.
