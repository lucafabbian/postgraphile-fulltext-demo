The following article is a list of government defeats in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom since 1945; that is, where the government whips have instructed their MPs to vote (or, in rare circumstances, abstain from voting) a certain way on a division of the House and have subsequently been defeated. Whilst most defeats have been on motions or bills scheduled in "government time", on occasion motions proposed by opposition parties or backbench MPs that are critical of government policy or practice, such as opposition day motions, are passed despite the government's efforts.
Most government defeats since World War II have occurred in periods of minority government or where the government has a small majority. Government defeats have been caused by backbench rebellions and by opposition parties voting against a government when they had more MPs present in the House of Commons. Earlier (1918–1945) large (of a margin of more than 100) defeats of governments were for the first MacDonald government, which suffered defeats by a margin of 166 on 8 October 1924 on the Campbell case, and by a margin of 140 in June 1924.

An amendment tabled by Hilary Benn and Alistair Burt requiring the House of Commons to sit for five days following any fortnightly statement, even during a prorogation, was passed 315–274.
The House of Commons accepted a House of Lords amendment to Dominic Grieve's amendment, further strengthening Parliament's power to sit despite prorogation, 315–273.In addition, three humble addresses were passed without division. Unlike Opposition Day motions, these are binding.

1 November 2017: A humble address for a return from Labour intended to force the Government to furnish hitherto unpublished sectoral impact assessments to the Exiting the European Union Select Committee was passed without division. It later transpired that the impact assessments did not exist, despite assurances from Brexit Secretary David Davis that they had been created in excruciating detail.
5 December 2017: A humble address for a return from Labour to force the Government to publish five project assessment reviews linked to Universal Credit was passed without division.
13 November 2018: A humble address for a return from Labour to force the Government to publish the "full and final" legal advice regarding the Brexit withdrawal agreement was passed without division.


== Johnson (minority, 2019) ==

Boris Johnson's government from July 2019 until the general election in December was defeated on 12 divisions in the House of Commons. It lost its working majority on its first sitting day of Parliament and was defeated on its very first division. Johnson became the first Prime Minister this happened to since Lord Rosebery in 1894. The government did not win a single division until 15 October, six weeks after Parliament's first sitting.
3 September 2019: The Government was defeated 328–301 on an emergency debate motion on the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill that would force the government to request an extension to Brexit negotiations.
4 September 2019:
The second reading of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill, mandating Johnson to seek an extension to the Brexit negotiations, passed 329–300.
The third reading of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill passed 327–299.
A motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 calling for an early election failed 298–56, well short of the 434 required for such a motion to pass. Labour whipped its MPs to abstain, as the party wanted an election, but not before a no-deal Brexit had been prevented.
9 September 2019:
A humble address to force the government to publish documents regarding no-deal preparations under Operation Yellowhammer and correspondence regarding prorogation was passed 311–302.
Another motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 calling for an early election failed 293–47, well short of the 434 required for such a motion to pass. Labour MPs again abstained.
26 September 2019: A motion to recess Parliament during the Conservative Party Conference, after the prorogation of Parliament was declared void, was defeated 289–306. This was the first time that a major UK-wide party had failed to win a recess for party conference season.
17 October 2019: An amendment to a government motion, extending the proposed Saturday sitting to debate the Brexit withdrawal agreement and allowing multiple amendments to be put to a vote, passed 287–275.
19 October 2019: An amendment by Oliver Letwin withholding Parliament's approval for the Brexit withdrawal agreement until the necessary law has been passed to enact it, thereby requiring Boris Johnson to request an Article 50 extension until 31 January 2020 under the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.6) Bill, passed 322–306.
22 October 2019: The government's programme motion, which would have provided only three days for the House of Commons to debate the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, was defeated 322–308.
28 October 2019: A third motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 calling for an early election failed 299–70, well short of the 434 required for such a motion to pass.
29 October 2019: An amendment by Stella Creasy to a Business of the House motion for an Early Parliamentary General Election bill to ensure that amendments to the bill could be submitted by MPs not acting on behalf of the Government passed 312–295. Furthermore, an opposition amendment to the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 6) Bill on 4 September 2019, requiring that Parliament vote again on the withdrawal agreement negotiated by May, passed by default after the government failed to provide any tellers for the No lobby. Although this was officially a defeat for the government, political commentators speculated it was a deliberate attempt either to insert a wrecking amendment or to obscure the potential support for May's deal.


== Johnson (majority, 2019–2022) ==

Since the 2019 general election, after which the Conservatives held 365 seats, Boris Johnson's second government has been defeated four times in the House of Commons.

24 June 2020:  A humble address to force the publication of documents relating to the approval of planning permission for the Westferry Printworks Development passed without division.
18 January 2021: Two Opposition Day motions from Labour were passed after a forced division. The first, on universal credit and working tax credit, passed 278–0; the second, on access to remote education and the quality of free school meals, passed 272–0, with most Conservative MPs not voting.
15 September 2021: An Opposition Day motion from Labour, calling on the government to cancel a planned £20-per-week cut in Universal Credit, was passed 253–0.
