== Composition ==
"Million Miles an Hour" is an uptempo song with a duration of four minutes and ten seconds, and has been described as a hard rock and electronic rock song. Its instrumentation consists primarily of guitar and "throbbing" synths, while the vocals are layered and distorted to sound as though they are coming from underwater. Deviating from the post-grunge sound for which the band is known, "Million Miles an Hour" is one of the more electronic-influenced tracks on No Fixed Address.
According to Kroeger, the song's lyrics are about tripping on LSD.
