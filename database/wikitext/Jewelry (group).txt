== History ==


=== 2001–2003: Debut, line-up changes, Again & Beloved ===
Jewelry founding members Park Jung-ah, Lee Ji-hyun, Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin debuted in 2001 with their debut studio album Discovery. After less-than-stellar sales of the first album, two of the singers (Jun Eun-mi and Jung Yoo-jin) were replaced by Seo In-young and Cho Min-ah.A year later, their second studio album, Again, was released, with much better results. Full of strong R&B ballads (as opposed to the sexy dance songs that were popular at that time), the album quickly yielded two high-charting singles — "Again" and "Tonight" — which started the group's rise to popularity.  This was quickly followed by their third studio album Beloved, which had a very cutesy theme. Their first single "니가 참 좋아" ("I Really Like You") was very poppy and had Jewelry adopt a cutesy concept to match the song, with colorful outfits and perky dances. The title track, Be My Love, was also promoted. Even though album sales for Again and Beloved were great, the group was unhappy with their current image, and did not want to be known for only their cute and innocent songs.


=== 2004–2007: Entry into Japan, breakout album: Superstar & line-up changes ===
After the success of their second album, Jewelry left for Japan to start on their career there in 2004 with their first single Kokoro ga Tomaranai under the independent label Giza Studio. After releasing a few materials there with mediocre sales, the group eventually left to return to their native country to release their fourth album.
By the time their fourth album Superstar came out in the beginning of 2005, Jewelry has since shed their "cute image" concept. Following the trend in Korean pop, they became sexier and more womanly, which helped bring about their current level of success. The first single "Superstar" (written by Shinhwa member Lee Min-woo) was a driven rock song and surprisingly became a huge hit. They followed this up with the sexy R&B number "Passion", which also charted strongly. Both of these singles prominently featured "sexy" member Seo In-Young dance scantily-clad in short shorts, which brought the group much press attention (both positive and negative).
In 2006, Jewelry took a break from the Korean music industry in order to focus on Japan. During that time, member Ji-hyun left to pursue an acting career. In early November, news leaked out that another member, Cho Min-ah, had also left, which forced their record company to look for a second replacement member.  As Park Jung-Ah and Seo In-young had solo projects, a new album was not expected until mid-2007.


=== 2008: Line-up changes, rise in fame with Kitchi Island & Everybody Shh! ===
In early 2008, Jewelry returned to the music scene with their new members Baby J and Eunjung with the release of their fifth album, Kitchi Island. Released on February 20, 2008, the album featured the single "One More Time", a cover of In-Grid's song, composed by Sannie Carlson (Whigfield). "One More Time" has mirrored the success of Jewelry's 2005 hit single, "Superstar" in South Korea, reaching the No. 1 spot on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank, two weeks after the song's debut. The single has also achieved success online, topping the charts of various music websites, including Melon, Dosirak, Bugs Music, M.Net.com, Muz and Juke On. "One More Time" became the most successful single of Jewelry to date, staying on the no.1 spot for 7 weeks in a row on MBC's Music Core and KBS's Music Bank. In spring of 2008, a second single, "모두 다 쉿" ("Everybody Shh!"), was released and promoted.
The group was awarded with a Daesang (대상, a "Top Award"), for highest digital sales in 2008.
