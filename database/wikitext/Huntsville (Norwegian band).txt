Huntsville (established 2006 in Oslo, Norway) is an experimental jazz trio.


== Biography ==
Huntsville was formed by three Norwegian veterans of creative jazz music, the guitarist Ivar Grydeland, bassist Tonny Klutten and percussionist Ingar Zach. They perform their instruments in unorthodox manners and then manipulated their sounds to obtain the post-modern reinvention of folk, jazz, raga and drone music for their debut album For The Middle Class ( 2006). Here we may note the 15 minute tune "The Appearance Of A Wise Child" and the 22 minute tune "Add A Key Of Humanity". Their music is described as energetic and intense, and they have played a variety of concerts internationally and in Norway.
