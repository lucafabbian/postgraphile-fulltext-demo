The Ice Climbing World Cup (or UIAA Ice Climbing World Tour, or IWC) is an annual ice climbing competition organized by the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation (UIAA), who has regulated and governed the sport of competition ice climbing since the first IWC in 2002.


== Structure ==
The IWC is organized as an annual tour consisting of over three to six events throughout the year (the number has varied over the years), in which men's and women's lead climbing and  speed climbing competitions are held.  The lead climbing routes are held on largely bolted dry artificial surfaces (with some natural ice features) and thus employ dry-tooling techniques. The speed-climbing routes are on a standardized 40-50 foot wall of solid ice that takes seconds for top roped ice climbers to complete (as per speed rock climbing).Over the years, the UIAA has increased the regulation and use around competition ice climbing equipment, including the prohibition of leashes on ice tools (so they cannot be used as aid), and increased controls on the use of "heel spurs" while climbing (to counter their use for resting).
