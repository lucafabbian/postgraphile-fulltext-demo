Jean Pascal vs. Bernard Hopkins II, billed as Dynasty II, was a light heavyweight championship fight for the WBC, IBO, and The Ring light heavyweight titles. The bout was held on May 21, 2011, at Bell Centre, Montreal in Quebec, Canada and was televised on HBO.


== Background ==
The WBC ordered a rematch between light heavyweight champion Jean Pascal and former champion Bernard Hopkins, three weeks after they fought to a highly disputed draw back in December.
The WBC's ruling, however, could have meant that Pascal, also the lineal champion, could be stripped of his alphabet title because he may have to fight Dawson in a rematch of their August fight.
When Pascal defeated Dawson by 11th-round technical decision last summer, Dawson had a rematch clause in his contract in the event of a loss.
The contract allowed both fighters to take interim bouts before the rematch was due. Dawson (29-1, 17 KOs) did not take one. However, Pascal did—and fought to the draw with Hopkins.
Dawson fought Bernard Hopkins on October 15, 2011.


== Referee and Judges ==
The referee for the fight is British Ian John-Lewis, and the judges are Philippines' Rey Danseco, Anek Hongtongkam of Thailand, and Italy's Guido Cavalleri . John-Lewis had previously been referee for fights involving  Vitali Klitschko and Shannon Briggs fight in October 2010.
