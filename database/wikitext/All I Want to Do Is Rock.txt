"All I Want to Do Is Rock" is the debut single from Scottish band Travis. Originally released as a 10" vinyl on the Red Telephone Box label in 1996, it was fully re-released by Independiente Records a year later, after the band signed with the label to record Good Feeling. The band frequently refers to the track as their "theme song" or their "national anthem", and as of 2009, have added the song back onto their live set lists. The song later appeared as a snippet on Hellboy 2.
