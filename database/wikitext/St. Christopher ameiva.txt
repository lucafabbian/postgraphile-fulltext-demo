The St. Christopher ameiva (Pholidoscelis erythrocephalus) is a lizard species in the genus Pholidoscelis. It is found on the Caribbean island of Sint Eustatius, and on Saint Kitts and Nevis, where it is more scarce.


== Description ==
Adult males reach a length of 13.5 cm (5.3 in) snout-to-vent. Adults of both sexes have a dark olive-green dorsal surface, tinged with reddish brown. Its head is more reddish and its sides more pink. Its underside is blue-gray, with a peach-colored throat and chin separated by a darker region. Its flanks are spotted and marbled, and its back and sides have narrow stripes along its length that fade towards its tail.


== Taxonomy ==
The St. Christopher ameiva was originally described in early 1802 by George Shaw as Lacerta erythrocephala. It was also described in August 1802 by Fran√ßois Marie Daudin as Ameiva erythrocephala, though as Shaw's work was published at least 7 months prior to Daudin's, his name had priority. The type locality is on Saint Christopher island in the West Indies.  In 2016, it was redescribed as Pholidoscelis erythrocephala along with other West Indies ameiva species.
