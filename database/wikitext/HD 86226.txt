HD 86226 is a G-type yellowish white star found in the constellation of Hydra.
A survey in 2015 has ruled out the existence of any stellar companions at projected distances above 12 astronomical units.Radio emission at a frequency of 150 MHz has been tentatively detected from the proximity of this system, although it is not clear whether the star or a satellite orbiting a rapidly rotating planet is the source.

Due to the periodic spectrum shifts when it had when placed under a Doppler test, 13 Magellan Doppler Velocity observations were made of an object found near the star. The object discovered in 2010 had a Keplerian orbit, was declared an exoplanet and dubbed HD 86226 b.A hot Super-Earth planet called HD 86226 c was also discovered in 2020. It may be undergoing considerable atmospheric mass loss.
