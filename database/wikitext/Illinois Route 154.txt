SBI Route 154 originally ran from Pinckneyville to U.S. Route 51 north of Sunfield. In 1937 it was extended west to Red Bud, replacing Illinois Route 170 and Illinois Route 13 in the process. In 1984, Illinois 154 was extended east on a new road over Rend Lake, replacing IL 183. The original 1926 routing of Illinois 183 is most likely underwater.
