Top Chef is an Arabic-language reality competition series based on the American television series of the same name. The contestants compete against each another in culinary challenges and are judged by the show presenter Siham Tueni, head chef Joe Barza, and a weekly panel of professional chefs and other personalities from the food industry, with one or more contestants eliminated in each episode.


== Show format ==
Each episode has two main challenges; the Quickfire Challenge and the Elimination Challenge.
In the Quickfire Challenge, each contestant is required to cook a dish with specific requirements or participate in a culinary-related challenge within one hour or less. A guest judge selects one or more chefs as the best in the challenge.
In the Elimination Challenge, the contestants have to prepare one or more dishes to meet the challenge requirements. Some of these challenges can be individual while others could require teamwork. After the Elimination Challenge ends, the four judges consider the guests' comments and deliberate on the best and worst dishes.
