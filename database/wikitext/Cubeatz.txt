== Early life and career ==
Kevin and Tim Gomringer were born as twin brothers on 15 March 1991 in Sindelfingen. They grew up in what Kevin described as a "forest village", where, for them, it was "rainy" and "lonely", which led them to build their craft, or, as Kevin says, "fantasy in their minds". Their parents had a radio receiver and a CD player, with various "classic" records by Bj√∂rk, U2, Michael Jackson, and more, which further helped them as inspiration to start making music. They started making beats with the DAW software Cubase, which led them to making their stage name "Cubeatz". They eventually started putting their beats on YouTube around the time it launched. In 2008, they earned their first record with German rapper Vega, which led them to making beats for the following six years.In late 2014, a "friend" of them sent a composition of theirs to American record producer Vinylz, which later evolved into the song R.I.C.O., by rapper Meek Mill featuring Canadian rapper Drake in mid-2015, with additional production by American record producer Allen Ritter. Since then, they were able to send their "original samples" off to other major record producers such as Metro Boomin, Cardo, Boi-1da, Murda Beatz, and much more, gaining momentum in the music industry and garnering a lot of high-profile collaborations with Drake, Travis Scott, Future, 21 Savage, and Don Toliver, among others.
