2-Hexyne is an organic compound that belongs to the alkyne group. Just like its isomers, it also has the chemical formula of C6H10.


== Reactions ==
2-Hexyne can be semihydrogenated to yield 2-hexene or fully hydrogenated to hexane. With appropriate noble metal catalysts it can selectively form cis-2-hexene.2-Hexyne can act as a ligand on gold atoms.With strong sulfuric acid, the ketone 2-hexanone is produced. However this reaction also causes polymerization and charring.Under heat and pressure 2-hexyne polymerizes to linear oligomers and polymers. This can be hastened by some catalysts such as molybdenum pentachloride with tetraphenyl tin. However Zieglerâ€“Natta catalysts have no action as the triple bond is hindered.
