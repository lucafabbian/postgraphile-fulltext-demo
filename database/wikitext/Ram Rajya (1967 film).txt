Ram Rajya (The Kingdom Of Rama) is an Indian 1967 Hindi religious film based on Valmiki's Ramayana and directed by Vijay Bhatt. The film was produced by Shankarbhai Bhatt. The music director was Vasant Desai with lyrics written by Bharat Vyas. The cinematographer was Pravin Bhatt and the film starred Bina Rai, Kumar Sen, Badri Prasad, Kanhaiyalal, Farida dadi, Anil Kumar, Jay Vijay.The film was a combination of Valmiki's Ramayana, with Tulsidas' Ramcharitmanas and Bhavbhuti's play "Uttar Ramcharit" according to the credit roll, and a remake of Bhatt's classic film of the 1940s of the same name. This time the film was in colour and instead of Shobhana Samarth, it had Bina Rai as Sita.  However, as cited in "Illustrated Weekly of India", Rai's role as the "masochistic Indian woman" towards the end of Rai's career as an actress disappointed the audiences and she was unacceptable as Sita.

== Vijay Bhatt And Ramayana ==
Vijay Bhatt had earlier made several films based on the epic Ramayana, which  included Bharat Milap (1942), Ram Rajya (1943) and Rambaan (1948) and they had all proved successful at the box-office. Bhatt is cited by Rajadhyaksha and Willemen as stating that his "interest in Hindu fantasy was a logical extension of his Gandhian sympathies".


== Soundtrack ==
The highlight of the soundtrack was a Ragmala composed by music director Vasant Desai with lyrics by Bharat Vyas performed by Kathak dancer Gopi Krishna and actress Snehlata. Desai had a "penchant" for using Raga Malhar in songs like "Dar Laage Garje Badariya" sung by Lata Mangeshkar. According to Raju Bharatan, Vasant Desai had been chosen as a recipient for the inaugural 'Dr. Brihaspati Award", later known as the "Saraswati Award", but it was pointed out by composer Naushad that two of the songs from the 1967 Ram Rajya were "replicate" songs from the original Ram Rajya (1943) composed for it by Shankar Rao Vyas. The award (Saraswati Award) that year (1968) went to Naushad for the film Palki (1967). The playback singers were Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi, Manna Dey, Suman Kalyanpur and Usha Timothy.
