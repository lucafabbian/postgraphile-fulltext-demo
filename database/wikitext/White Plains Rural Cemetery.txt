White Plains Rural Cemetery is a historic cemetery located in the city of White Plains, Westchester County, New York. The cemetery was organized in 1854 and designed in 1855.  It contains miles of narrow, paved roads, none of which is in a straight line.  The roads create circular and lozenge-shaped areas for burials.  Also on the property is a former church, now cemetery office.  It was built in 1797, and is a 2+1‚ÅÑ2-story, five-by-three-bay frame building with a high-pitched gable roof.  It was modified for office use in 1881.

The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003.
