Orange Skies Day was a climatological event that occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area on September 9, 2020. The orange-colored hue in the sky was the result of smoke from the North Complex Fire (including the Bear Fire) and more than 20 other wildfires, which burned more than 2 million acres east of the San Francisco Bay Area. This smoke scattered blue light wavelengths, which only allowed warmer colors to reach the Earth's surface.Because the sun failed to appear in the morning, light-sensitive bridge and street lights remained alight the entire day, and drivers were recommended to keep their headlights on all day. Daniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist, wrote that the smoke was "almost completely blocking out the sun across some portions of Northern California." In a tweet, the San Francisco Fire Department stated, "We know the smoke, darkness and orange glow is scary. It is going to get better."Public officials blamed the event on climate change. California Governor Gavin Newsom stated, "I quite literally have no patience for climate change deniers. Itâ€™s completely inconsistent, that point of view, with the reality on the ground." In popular culture, the day was compared to the apocalyptic films Blade Runner 2049 and Dune.
