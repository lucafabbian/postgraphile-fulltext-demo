The battalion deployed to Baghdad, Iraq in February 2007 in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) 07-08 as part of "The Surge." From February 2007 - April 2008, 2-32FA conducted infantry and security operations in southeast Mansour, Baghdad and established and manned Joint Security Station (JSS) Torch with Iraqi Defense & Police.


==== Pre-World War II ====
Organized at Camp Meade, Maryland, in 1918, the 32nd Field Artillery Regiment was in training at the end of World War I.

==== Inactive years, Desert Storm and drawdown ====
Inactivated at Fort Lewis in 1972, the battalion spent 15 years on the inactive roll until its activation on 16 August 1987 as a member of the 42d FA Brigade. The battalion was equipped with Lance missiles until 1989, when the battalion was inactivated once again. In 1990 the battalion was activated in Giessen, Germany as the first active ATACMS capable MLRS unit. When USAREUR was tasked with providing units for deployment for Desert Shield it was decided that the battalion and its ATACMS capability should remain in Germany as a strategic theater-level deterrent to the Soviets. However, a select number of soldiers from the battalion were attached to other deploying MLRS units  to bring them up to 100% strength. After Desert Storm, the unit was reassigned to 41st FA Brigade. After the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the battalion cased its colors once again, on 15 December 1993 in Giessen, Germany.
