"Hitchin' a Ride" is a song written by Mitch Murray and Peter Callander issued as a single by the English pop/rock band Vanity Fare in late 1969. It reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart in February 1970 but was a bigger hit in the United States, reaching number 5 on the Hot 100 on June 27, 1970. Billboard ranked the record as the number 14 song of 1970.  In Chicago, the record achieved even greater heights, topping the WCFL Big 10 Countdown on 18–25 May 1970, ranking #4 for all of 1970 and ranking #12 on rival WLS Radio 89 Hit Parade on 6 July 1970, ranking #10 for all of 1970. "Hitchin' a Ride" sold a million copies in the United States alone, and it became a gold record.


== Background ==
The song is about a young man who is attempting to hitchhike since he has no money. The song is noted for its two recorders first heard in the introduction as well as in the sections between the choruses and the verses.
The song is also noted for its instrumental section, featuring an electric piano, that plays a bass line in repetition, which is accompanied by the piano's upper register, bass, drums, and guitar, which is later heard before the song's fade. The U.S. single edit shortens the ending by eliminating the final repeated lines of "ride, ride" before the song fades out.

=== Critical reception ===
Bill Coleman from Billboard wrote, "U.K. siren continues her bid for American stardom with a peppy, HiNRG cover of the Vanity Fare nugget." David Giles from Music Week stated that the song has been "given an ultra-glossy Hi-NRG sheen". He added that "it sounds a little dated, reminiscent perhaps of Kelly Marie's "Feels Like I'm in Love", but should still clear the shelves."
