The Games of Texas are a series of amateur Olympic-style events held each summer and winter in the U.S. state of Texas.  They are organized by the Texas Amateur Athletic Federation (TAAF) and are part of the National Congress of State Games.  Medalists from the Games qualify to participate in the State Games of America, a biennial multi-sport event.

The Summer Games of Texas are held every year across multiple venues in a pre-designated city or region.  The event is usually held in late July and draws more than 10,000 athletes and 15,000â€“20,000 spectators each year.  It is the largest multi-sport event in Texas.  Each year at the games, TAAF organizes the opening ceremonies, which typically include a parade of athletes and fireworks.  In 2010 and 2011, the event was hosted by Waco, Texas.  In 2012 and 2013, it will be hosted by Corpus Christi, Texas.
