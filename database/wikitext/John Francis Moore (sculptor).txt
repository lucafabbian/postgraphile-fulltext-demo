John Francis Moore (died 1809) was a sculptor who was active in late 18th century Britain. His works include two memorials in Westminster Abbey.


== Life ==
Moore was of British extraction but was born in Hanover, Germany around 1725. While he was presumably raised and educated in Germany he moved to Britain around 1760. In 1766 his first presentation to the Society of Arts is noted: a relief sculpture entitled Britannia Reviver of Antique, Prompter to Modern Art.
Moore was married to Mary, only daughter and sole heir of John Early (d.1748), a corn chandler and proprietor, by whom he had three sons, John Francis, Charles and James (d.1816) and three daughters, Maria Teresa, Elizabeth Ann and Frances Agnes.
His eldest son, John Francis Moore the younger (d.1793) was also a sculptor but of lesser note. He died young and his father thereafter went into partnership with a 'J. Smith' from 1790 onwards. Moore's youngest sons followed their father's artistic career and became painters.
Moore's granddaughter Elizabeth Moore (1791-1864) of Leyton, Essex was married to Lord Mayor of London and wine merchant John Kinnersley Hooper (1791-1854).
Moore died on 21 January 1809 at Wells Street off Oxford Street, London.
