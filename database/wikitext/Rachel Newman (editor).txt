Rachel Newman (born May 1, 1938) is an American magazine editor and artist, daughter of Maurice Newman and Edythe Brenda Tichell.  She was raised in Massachusetts and Virginia, and currently resides in New York City.


== Publishing career ==
After graduating from Pennsylvania State University, Newman received certification from the New York School of Interior Design.  She worked in advertising and then publishing, creating numerous magazines for Hearst Communications.  Country Living was conceived by her mentor, John Mack Carter, to create a view of Early American and period homes echoing the architectural and furniture styles brought to the U.S. by early European settlers.  Carter selected Newman to run the magazine, and during her 20-year stint she made several television appearances and was considered a "master" of her profession. Advertising Age listed Country Living as the hottest magazine 5 years in a row (1993-1997).  She eventually shifted from the Country Living family of magazines to start Healthy living magazine, which was designed to support the growing interest in natural and alternative medicine; during that period, she also served on the board of Mothers and Others for a Livable Planet.
Newman's affiliations include the American Society of Magazine Editors and the American Society of Interior Designers.  Her achievements were recognized by the International Furnishings Design Association (Circle of Excellence, 1992, now known as the IFDA's Honorary Recognition Award), the YMCA (Hall of Fame, 1992), Pennsylvania State University (distinguished alumna, 1998, and alumni fellow, 1986) and Who's Who (Finance and Business, East, American Women).  Magazines that Newman ran include:

Country Living, editor emeritus (1999 to present) and editor-in-chief (1978–98)
Healthy Living, founding editor (1996-2000)
Country Living Gardener, founding editor (1993-2000)
