He has translated works of German, French and Russian literature. In particular he is noted for his translations of the German writer Uwe Timm. These include the titles Midsummer Night, Headhunter, and The Snake Tree, the last of which won the Schlegel-Tieck Prize. Tegel has also translated the plays of Bertolt Brecht.
