The  New Zealand DSG class is a type of diesel-electric shunting locomotive used in New Zealand. The class shares a central cab design with the smaller DSC class shunting locomotive, and is twin-engined. Meanwhile, the very similarly designed, single-engined DSJ class, has a cab that is offset from the centre.


== Introduction ==
The DSG class shunters were built in four batches from 1981 to 1983. The first batch of six locomotives was introduced in 1981, followed by batches in 1982 and 1983.


== In Service ==
The locomotives have seen widespread use throughout New Zealand, particularly in larger yards and for port traffic. They also see service on sections of mainline, performing regional shunt duties in a number of areas.


== Livery ==
All DSG class locomotives are in the KiwiRail Mark 2 colour scheme (Vertical separations of main colours on car body).
