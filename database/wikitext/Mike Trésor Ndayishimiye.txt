Mike Trésor Ndayishimiye (born 28 May 1999) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays for Belgian club Genk.


== Club career ==
Having been a youth team player at Anderlecht, Trésor made his Eerste Divisie debut for NEC on 21 September 2018 in a game against Helmond Sport, as a 78th-minute substitute for Jonathan Okita.On 2 September 2019, he joined Willem II in the top-tier Eredivisie on loan for the 2019–20 season. On 30 October, Ndayishimiye scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win against Quick in the first round of the KNVB Cup.Trésor moved to Belgian Cup holders Racing Genk in July 2021. After a disappointing campaign where defensive frailty saw Cup-winning coach John van den Brom dismissed mid-season, and Bernd Storck only able to guide Genk to the 2022 Belgian Pro League's European play-offs, Trésor's form surged under the tenureship of new coach Wouter Vrancken.  
Genk lost their opening league game of the 2022-23 season to champions Club Brugge, before going on to win 15 of their next 16 league games - drawing the other one for an unbeaten run of 16 - to go ten points clear of second-placed Union St-Gilloise by Christmas 2022, still top of the table by Easter 2023.   
Trésor had hit double-figures in assists for the 2022-23 season by mid-October as part of Genk's impressive winning run, making his the highest-assist maker in the top-10 ranked European leagues.Despite this, Trésor was not named by Belgium national team coach Roberto Martinez in the preliminary Belgian squad of 55 ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup, and didn't make the plane for Qatar.  A continuation in strong form saw big calls for Trésor and team-mate Bryan Heynen to be capped by new national team coach Domenico Tedesco for his first games in charge against Sweden and Germany in March 2023, but neither player was chosen. 


== Personal life ==
He is a son of Burundian former international footballer, Freddy Ndayishimiye.
