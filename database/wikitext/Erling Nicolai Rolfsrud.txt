== Early life and teaching career ==
Rolfsrud was born near Keene, North Dakota to Nils (1878–1920) and Rebecca Rolfsrud (1875–1935), Norwegian immigrant homesteaders. He graduated from Watford City, North Dakota. After attending a summer term at Minot State Teachers College (now Minot State University), Rolfrud taught three terms of rural school in McKenzie County. During his time teaching at Rocky Glen School, Rolfrud sold his first children's story. Later, he would go on to graduate from Concordia College, Moorhead, Minnesota. He taught in secondary schools, then headed the department of business education at Concordia for five years. He retired in 1978 to devote full-time to writing.
