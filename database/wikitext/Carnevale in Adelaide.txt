Carnevale in Adelaide is an annual Italian festival held in Adelaide, South Australia which follows the centuries-old Christian tradition of Carnevale which is the last celebration before Ash Wednesday and the beginning of Lent - see Carnival.


== Background and History ==
The first Carnevale in Adelaide was held in 1976 in Rundle Mall. A parade travelled from Victoria Square to Elder Park before ending with celebrations in Rundle Mall. It was originally called The Italian Festival and is now known as Carnevale in Adelaide. The festival has been held in a number of locations over the years including Rundle Mall,  Elder Park, Norwood and Adelaide Ovals, Rymill Park. In 2015 it was held at The Adelaide ShowgroundIt is a means of inspiring young  people to embrace their Italian heritage and for the wider community to  experience Italian culture. The event also raises funds to cater for welfare needs of the elderly in the Italian community through the Co-ordinating Italian Committee (CIC) and supports other worthy charities and community organisations.
