Samuel "Sam" Higgs, a former investigative journalist, returns to Basswood, West Virginia in light of his close friend Nick's death. He originally left Basswood following publication of his article about safety violations at the town's coal mines. The mines closed in the aftermath, ultimately leaving hundreds without jobs and angered townsfolk who despise Sam. During his stay in the town, Nick's daughter, Joan, asks him to check on the events leading up to Nick's death as she finds his activity before he died suspicious. Sam teams up with Anna, his ex-girlfriend who knew Nick well as they worked together at the newspaper Basswood Jungle, in hope that by following leads and investigating clues may lead to finding the source of Nick's death.


== Development ==
Partnering with publisher Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, Dontnod Entertainment began developing Twin Mirror in 2016 with a separate team of senior developers. About forty people were working on it as of September 2018. Lead writer Matthew Ritter was influenced by adventure games like Beneath a Steel Sky and Space Quest.Contrary to previous titles, Dontnod desired to have Twin Mirror be void of any supernatural elements. According to art director Pierre-Etienne Travers, the game's primary concept is duality. The decision to set it in a fictional American town, based on southern West Virginia, was to broaden its appeal.In June 2019, Dontnod announced to self-publish the game, with Bandai Namco Entertainment acting as the distributor for the console versions. As well as Shibuya Productions becoming a co-producer of the game. Bandai Namco decided to cancel the Japanese console versions of Twin Mirror shortly after Dontnod acquired the IP rights from Bandai.The game was originally designed as an episodic game when it was first revealed. Following the delay, the game was reworked and the episodic format was abandoned so it can be played without any interruptions.
