The sultani (Ottoman Turkish: سلطاني) was an Ottoman gold coin. It was first minted in 1477–8 during the reign of Mehmed II (r. 1451–1481), following the Venetian ducat standard, weighing about 3.45 grams (0.111 ozt). The sultani is the classic Ottoman gold coin also known generically as altın (آلتون, "gold").
