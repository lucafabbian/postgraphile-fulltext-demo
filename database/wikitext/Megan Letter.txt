== Careers ==


=== YouTube ===
In 2018, Letter was relatively unknown. At the time, she was making content on The Sims. After switching to Roblox after being unable to pay bills, she rapidly began gaining popularity under the stage name of "Megan Plays". As of April 2021, Letter was getting 40 million monthly views and had more than three million subscribers on her channel, MeganPlays. She is most known for making Adopt Me! videos.


=== Wonder Works ===
In 2020, Letter and her husband "Zach," created a Roblox game studio called Wonder Works (also known as Wonder Works Studio). One of the reasons is because Letter wanted more control over her content. Wonder Works also chose Roblox over Steam because most of her online followers already have Roblox installed on their device. Their first release was Overlook Bay, where you can adopt a pet, build a house and explore the city. Overlook Bay has been played more than 160 million times. The studio has also released another game called Traitor.
