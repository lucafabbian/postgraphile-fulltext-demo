== Foundation and early history ==
On 13 September 1932 a brief report in the pages of the Connacht Sentinel announced the formation of a new rugby club in Galway. Its membership was drawn largely from Galway's inner city and working class and was composed in the main of students and players of St Joseph's Patrician College (The Bish) and the Galway Grammar School. The following evening the Club held its first meeting in the Mechanic's Institute in Middle Street at 8 pm, and from that meeting its first Senior Committee emerged:
Harry Warner - founding President; M Gallagher - Vice President; J Toner - Hon Treasurer; J Brown - Hon Secretary; J Owens - Assistant Secretary; T Mullins, G Mahont, M Roche, P O'Flaherty, W Lenihan, P Griffin, T Liodain - Committee Members.
