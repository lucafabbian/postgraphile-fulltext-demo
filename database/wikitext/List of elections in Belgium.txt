This is an overview of all regular elections held in the Kingdom of Belgium since its independence. This excludes local referendums and special elections (by-elections) that existed before 1919. Municipal elections prior to 1919 are not listed either.


== Constituent elections (1830) ==
Elections to the temporary National Congress:

3 November 1830


== Unitary state (1831–1994) ==


=== Elections in 1831–1919 ===
Representatives were elected for a 4-year term; half of the Chamber was up for election each two years. Senators were elected for an 8-year term; half of the Senate was up for election each four years. The first series (referenced as "E" here) consisted of the provinces of East Flanders, Hainaut, Liège and Limburg; the second series ("A" below) of Antwerp, Brabant, Luxembourg, Namur and West Flanders.
An equivalent system applied to elections for municipal and provincial councils.


=== Elections in 1919–1994 ===


== Federal state (1994–present) ==
The 1993–1994 fourth state reform had far-reaching consequences for the institutional structure of the country.
Local elections (six-year terms) include provincial and municipal elections, as well as district elections in Antwerp.
Regional elections (five-year terms, concurrently with European elections) are elections to the different parliaments of communities and regions: the Flemish Parliament, the Walloon Parliament, the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region, the Parliament of the German-speaking Community and indirectly the Parliament of the French Community and the three assemblies of the community commissions in Brussels.
