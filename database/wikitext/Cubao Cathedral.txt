Cubao Cathedral, formally known as the Immaculate Conception Cathedral of Cubao, is a Roman Catholic cathedral located in Quezon City, Metro Manila, the Philippines. It is the episcopal seat of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Cubao. Built in 1950 by the Society of the Divine Word, it belonged to the order until 1990, when the Archdiocese of Manila took over its administration. In 2003, when the Diocese of Cubao was erected, the parish was elevated into the status of cathedral. The present rector of the cathedral is Rev. Fr. Dennis S. Soriano,  


== History ==
In 1935, the SVD priests of Christ the King Mission Seminary began ministering to a limited farming community around Manga Road in Cubao by first celebrating Mass in a small chapel near the present Cubao roundabout. Fr. Henry Demond, SVD, then celebrated Mass in the house of a certain Carbonell family, then moved to a quonset mess hall from the Second World War that stood on what are now Spencer and Brooklyn streets. The building was abandoned by the combined US-Philippine Commonwealth Armed Forces.
As with other agrarian communities, farmers tilling the area's rice paddies invoked San Isidro Labrador, so the chapel was dedicated to him and belonged to Sacred Heart Parish in the Kamuníng area. While teaching as theology professor at Christ the King Mission Seminary (and later as Prefect of Scholastics), Fr. Ambrosio Manaligod and Ronnie Ganancias consistently helped with the pastoral work of the parish, especially in directing lay organizations.
In 1949, the chapel was re-dedicated to the Immaculate Conception. On July 15, 1950, the community chapel was elevated into a parish, with the first curé being the Argentine Fr. Juan Simón (1950–1954); he was succeeded by the German Fr. Alois Vogel (1954-1956) and Fr. Benito Rixner (1956–1958). For years, the parish remained under the SVD, as it was near the order's main residence at Christ the King Mission Seminary.In 1989, the SVD offered the parish to the Archdiocese of Manila in keeping with the missionary spirit found in their constitutions. The official handover took place on Easter Sunday, 1990, with Msgr. Reynaldo Celso as the first secular or diocesan parish priest. Due to an increase in the population of Catholics in Metro Manila, the Archdiocese was gradually partitioned, with the Diocese of Cubao erected on August 28, 2003. The parish was selected to be the see for the new bishop, and extensive renovations on the church were carried out soon after.On December 30, 2014, GMA Network, actor Dingdong Dantes and actress Marian Rivera were married at the cathedral, where Dantes was christened. Considered as one of the most expensive church weddings held in the country, guests included then-President Benigno S. Aquino III as the principal sponsor, other politicians, the couple's colleagues from the television and film industry, and various celebrities.
