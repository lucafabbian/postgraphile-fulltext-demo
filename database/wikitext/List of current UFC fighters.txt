== Notes/key ==
This list provides an up-to-date roster of all fighters currently competing under the UFC promotional banner. The list excluded fighters who have not fought for more than two years and are not subjected to suspension.
All names presented are in accordance with Sherdog website profiles and may include common nicknames or alternative spellings rather than birth names.
Fighters are organized by weight class and within their weight class by their date of debut in the Endeavor (WEC, Strikeforce or UFC - which ever the earliest debut date).
Endeavor records below are based on the combination of total fights which fighters fought under UFC, Strikeforce and WEC.
MMA records below are retrieved from Sherdog's website.
All asterisked fighters are listed by a combination of their UFC, Strikeforce and WEC records.
The flags listed in these tables are in accordance with the Sherdog's website and may not fully or accurately represent the full citizenship of the peoples listed.
WC = Weight Class; G = Gender; SW = Strawweight; FYW = Flyweight; BW = Bantamweight; FW = Featherweight; LW = Lightweight; WW = Welterweight; MW = Middleweight; LHW = Light heavyweight; HW = Heavyweight; WSW = Women's strawweight; WFYW = Women's flyweight; WBW = Women's bantamweight; and WFW = Women's featherweight.
Fighters' age and height are based on information obtained from Sherdog's website.
Each fight record has four categories: wins, losses, draws and no-contests (NC).
Number of fighters in each division is counted as per date indicated only for the number could change week by week.
Rankings are based on information obtained from the UFC's website and updated when information has been obtained from the UFC's website ( /  = movement in rankings, (C) = Champion, (IC) = Interim Champion, and (NR) = not previously ranked).
The tables are sortable and the calculation for Endeavor and MMA records are formulated as follows: Plus one point of the total wins for fighters having not lost a fight: 5–0–0 = 6
Negative points of total losses for fighters having not won a fight: 0–3–0 = -3
Add number of wins to the winning percentage: 10–1–0 = 10.90 | 10 + (10/11)
A draw counts as 0.5: 8–4–1 = 8.65 | 8 + (8.5/13)
No contest does not factor as one of the variables of the calculation: 8–2–0 (1 NC) = 8.80 | 8 + (8/10)

== Rankings ==
The UFC rankings are rated by a panel made up of MMA media members. The panel votes for the top active fighters in the UFC by both weight class and pound-for-pound. A fighter can be ranked in multiple divisions at the same time in divisions they have competed. The champions and interim champions are placed in the top positions of their respective weight classes and only the champions are eligible to be voted for in the pound-for-pound rankings.
The rankings for the UFC's fighters are both recorded and updated when information has been obtained from the UFC's website.
