Challenger is a non-releasable bald eagle in the care of the non-profit American Eagle Foundation. He is the first bald eagle in history trained to free fly over stadium events, including the World Series and United States presidential inaugurations.


== Life ==
At some point, during a storm in 1989, Challenger was blown from his nest as an eaglet. He was found and fed by well-meaning humans who placed him with a rehabilitation program. During his early years, he experienced too much human contact and imprinted on his human handlers. Two unsuccessful release attempts resulted in Challenger being deemed non-releasable, and he was eventually being handed over to the Federal authorities. Authorities have since given Challenger to the American Eagle Foundation for care and educational programs. He lives with other birds of prey at in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Challenger is named in honor of the space shuttle crew, who were killed when it disintegrated shortly after launch.  
In 2019, on Challenger's 30th birthday, American Eagle Foundation announced that the eagle would be retired from free flights and make only gloved appearances.


== Awareness ==
Challenger has been an ambassador for his species since 1993. He has raised a great level of public awareness for the habitat destruction of the bald eagle. When the bald eagle was taken off the Endangered Species List, Challenger represented his species during the delisting ceremony at the White House.
