Tujetsch (Romansh pronunciation: [ˈtujətʃ] (listen); German: Tavetsch) is a municipality in the Surselva Region in the canton of Graubünden in Switzerland. It is the westernmost municipality of the canton, connected to Urseren (canton of Uri) by the Oberalp Pass.


== History ==

The upper Surselva was first settled in the 9th century, following the foundation of Disentis Abbey, as part of the Cadi (feudal possessions of the abbey). In the 12th century, the Walser migrated across Oberalp Pass. Sedrun parish church was first consecrated in 1205. Both Romansh and Walser communities lived exclusively in dispersed settlements well into the early modern period. The Walser were mostly Romanized, but some Alemannic toponymy remains on the left bank of the Rhine. In the 18th century, villages formed in the vicinity of parish churches, and most of the 66 scattered settlements recorded in the 16th century were abandoned. Sedrun became the main settlement and municipal capital. The economic focus shifted from alpine agriculture to the production of soapstone stoves and pottery. Population fell to below 900 people in the second half of the 19th century due to emigration. The development of the tourism industry in the first half of the 20th century resulted in moderate population growth, to 1,122 as of 1950.
Ski tourism and hydroelectricity were developed in the 1950s to 1960s.
Tujetsch was never the name of a village. As the name of the valley, Thiuesch is first recorded in 1237. The local variety of the Romansh language is markedly different from standard Sursilvan and is sometimes listed as a separate dialect, Tuatschin. The Tavetsch breed of sheep closely resembled Neolithic era livestock. The breed was extinct in 1954, and a breeding back project was initiated in 1984. The official name of the municipality was Tavetsch until 1976.
