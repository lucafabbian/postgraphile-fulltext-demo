Scott took up wheelchair rugby as part of his rehabilitation. Scott said "I always loved sport and participated in all kinds of sport – soccer, basketball, Aussie rules, pretty much every sport except able-bodied rugby. As a quadriplegic, I didn’t have the upper-body strength to play wheelchair basketball. When I saw wheelchair rugby, that’s when I thought that sport was still possible." Scott made his debut for the Australian team 'Steelers' in August 2001. He was a member of the Steelers that came fifth at the 2004 Athens Paralympics. He won a silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Games in the mixed wheelchair rugby event. He won a gold medal at the 2012 London Games in the mixed wheelchair rugby event.
