Tivoli Encounter is a live album by American jazz pianist Phineas Newborn, Jr. recorded in Denmark in 1979 at the first Copenhagen Jazz Festival but not released on the Dutch Storyville label until 1997.


== Reception ==
The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow states "Although still displaying impressive technique, Newborn does make some errors in spots and sounds just slightly past his prime. ...Not essential, but still worthwhile".
