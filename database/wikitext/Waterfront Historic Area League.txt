The Waterfront Historic Area LeaguE, also known as WHALE, is a non-profit historic preservation organization located in New Bedford, Massachusetts.  Its mission is: "to promote the value and reuse of greater New Bedford's historic structures through preservation, education and advocacy". The organization often promotes its cause with the words of one of its founders, Sarah Delano (President of WHALE, 1966-1982).  Delano said, "if you bulldoze your heritage, you become just anywhere".


== History ==
The organization was founded by a group of concerned citizens in 1962, at a time when urban renewal threatened much of the city's history and architectural heritage.  The original focus was on the city's waterfront district, a dense area of whaling era buildings suffering from severe neglect and disrepair.  WHALE took on the preservation/restoration of as many as 20 buildings within the district's boundaries over the years.  This became the organization's first neighborhood revitalization project and lead to the establishment of Bedford Landing Waterfront National Register Historic District.  With WHALE's leadership, the district would later be designated, New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park.  Over time, WHALE expanded to properties beyond this district, taking on preservation projects throughout the city.  WHALE has now completed over 45 preservation and restoration projects in the greater New Bedford area between 1962 and 2009.
