Saga of a Married Man is the seventh studio album by American recording artist Alexander O'Neal. It was originally released in early 2002 by Eagle as the follow-up to the 1996 album Lovers Again. Recording sessions took place at Echo Bay Studios and Hear, Inc. assisted by former Prince drummer, Bobby Z. O'Neal was credited as co-writer on the track "Married Man".
The album was received negatively by the majority of music critics, while other reviewers noted good points to the album. The album went largely unnoticed by the public, being a commercial disappointment, which marked the beginning of a downturn in O'Neal's fortunes on the album charts.
