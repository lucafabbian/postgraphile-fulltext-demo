Two to One is Thelma Houston's seventh studio album released on Motown Records in June 1978. It was her second duets album with Jerry Butler, composed of only two left-over duets from their Thelma & Jerry album from the previous year, "If It Would Never End" and "You Gave Me Love", padded out with previously unreleased solo recordings by each singer, Houston's "Find a Way", "I'm Not Strong Enough (To Love You Again)" and "Don't Pity Me", while Butler's tracks included "We Owe It to Ourselves", "Never Gonna Get Enough" and "Chicago Send Her Home".
The album failed to chart. It was released on CD in 2013 as a 2-LPs-on-1-CD package with the Thelma & Jerry album.
