== History ==
Bohra Ganesh Temple is believed to be about 350 years old. Originally named as 'Borganesh', the temple was built outside the then city boundary of Udaipur. But since then, due to expansion of city boundaries, this area now falls within under the city limits. Now the entire area is also known as Bohra Ganesh. This new name of this temple also has an interesting story behind. It is believed that 70â€“80 years ago people who needed money for purposes like marriage and business would write the requirement on a slip of paper and leave it before the idol. Soon he would get the amount needed, but in turn they had to return the amount with interest. In India, it is generally the Bohra cast which is involved in business of lending money. For this reason, Lord Ganesh here got named as Bohra Ganesh. However, it is also a common belief that devotees with real trust on Bohra Ganesh also get their wishes fulfilled.
