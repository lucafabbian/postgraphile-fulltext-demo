The Battle of Sultanabad occurred on February 13, 1812 between the Russian Empire and the Persian Empire. In the resulting battle, the Russians were routed.
The Persians, numerically superior, were led by Abbas Mirza and fought the Russians, led by Pyotr Kotlyarevsky. A Persian offensive into Georgia, with its British and French-trained Nezam-e Jadid infantry, initiated the battle. The Persians had also obtained European cannons from the French.The Persians won the battle by moving faster than the Russians and by attacking them near their camp. Although it was a minor victory for the Persians, Abbas Mirza tried to act as if it were a major victory.In the end, however, the Persians lost the invasion because of the Russian maneuvering around the Aras River which culminated in the Battle of Aslanduz. The Persians would have given up had it not been for the news of Napoleon's invasion of Russia in the spring.
