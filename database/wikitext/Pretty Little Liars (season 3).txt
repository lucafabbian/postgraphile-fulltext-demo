== Overview ==
The third season takes place five months following the discovery that Mona Vanderwaal (Janel Parrish) was the elusive "A" that had been creatively and relentlessly tormenting the four main characters, Aria Montgomery (Lucy Hale), Spencer Hastings (Troian Bellisario), Hanna Marin (Ashley Benson), and Emily Fields (Shay Mitchell) for the past year. The first half of the season addresses the issue of whether or not Garrett Reynolds (Yani Gellman) actually killed or was involved in the murder of the girls' former friend and queen bee, Alison DiLaurentis (Sasha Pieterse) and who killed Maya St. Germain (Bianca Lawson) in the season two finale, while the second half deals with the reveal that Toby Cavanaugh (Keegan Allen) is a member of the A-Team. While dealing with Maya's death Emily finds comfort with Paige McCullers (Lindsey Shaw) and the two enter a relationship. The girls see the arrival of CeCe Drake (Vanessa Ray) to Rosewood, a sister like figure to Alison. Spencer discovering the information about Toby sends her on a dark path, until Mona fakes Toby's death, which sends Spencer completely over the edge, leading to her being admitted to Radley. 
All this time, the girls continue to see Red Coat, a mysterious blonde in a red trench coat who is believed to be the leader of the A-Team. Mona visits Spencer at Radley and offers her the chance to join the A-Team, which Spencer, who wants answers on Toby, accepts. Spencer is released from Radley and comes home, but is unbeknownst to the girls, working with Mona/"A" to set up a party so that Red Coat can meet them all. As promised, Mona arranges Spencer a meeting with Toby, who is alive and well and reveals that he joined the A-Team to keep Spencer safe. Spencer and Toby then begin working on the inside to discover Red Coat's identity at the party. Red Coat flies in on a plane and Spencer and Toby go into the woods to watch her, while the girls corner Mona, as someone locks them inside the Lodge and sets it on fire. Spencer loses Red Coat in the woods, as the Lodge burns down with the girls inside. Hanna, unconscious, wakes up briefly, as she is pulled out of the Lodge by Red Coat, whom she sees as Alison DiLaurentis.
