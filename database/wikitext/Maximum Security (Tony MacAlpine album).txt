Maximum Security is the second studio album by guitarist Tony MacAlpine, released in 1987 through PolyGram. It is his only release to enter the U.S. Billboard 200, reaching No. 146 and remaining on that chart for eleven weeks.


== Critical reception ==
Andy Hinds at AllMusic gave Maximum Security 4.5 stars out of 5, calling it "much better" than MacAlpine's 1986 debut album Edge of Insanity, and "essential listening for anyone interested in instrumental guitar music"; its "captivating neoclassical/fusion forays are filled with plenty of beautiful melodies and hair-raising solos".
