John Paul College is an independent Roman Catholic co-educational high school located in South Kalgoorlie, Western Australia that caters to over 700 students from Years 7 to 12. It commenced in 1984, as a result of an amalgamation of Christian Brothers' College and Prendiville College. Its motto "Justice, Peace, Charity" includes the three beginning letters of the school's name: J, P and C.


== History ==


=== Christian Brothers' College ===
Christian Brothers' College was founded in 1906 in Wilson Street, by B Duggan, who served as Principal for ten years. Throughout its seventy-seven years, the College served the people of the Eastern Goldfields who supported the school, especially in time of financial hardship. In 1976 the college was relocated at Lionel Street by Bernard T Murphy. Hence, it continued its service to education with more modern facilities and more spacious grounds.


=== Prendiville College ===
Prendiville College was founded in 1971, replacing the four small existing secondary sections of the Parish schools. The college was founded as the Prendiville Catholic Girls College, named in honour of the late Archbishop Redmond Prendiville (Bishop of Perth, between 1933â€“1968). The first Principal was Sr. Concepta (Sisters of St. Joseph). The uniform was green and orange.


=== Merger ===
In 1984 Christian Brothers College amalgamated with Prendiville College.  The new school was aptly named John Paul College after Pope John Paul II, elected as Pope in 1978. For the first time a co-educational Catholic secondary school functioned in Kalgoorlie. The Christian Brothers and the Sisters of St. Joseph of the Sacred Heart have been on the Eastern Goldfields since the turn of the century.
