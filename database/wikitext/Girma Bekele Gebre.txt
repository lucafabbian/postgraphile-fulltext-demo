Gebre didn't have a sponsor or an agent, and the night before the race, he stayed with a friend in The Bronx and slept on a couch. In the race, he joined the lead pack in Brooklyn, where the elite and non-elite courses met. He was in the front group of five runners after 35 kilometres (22 mi) of the race, and was in the front four after another runner dropped away from the lead pack. He finished third in the race, and his finishing time of 2:08:38 was 25 seconds behind race winner Geoffrey Kamworor. He finished ahead of more experienced Ethiopians Tamirat Tola and Shura Kitata, and beat his previous personal best by over five minutes.

Gebre said he would use the money to help his family, and it took him 18 months to receive his prize money, as he doesn't have an American bank account.
