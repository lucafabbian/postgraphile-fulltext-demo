Mi Sangre (My Blood) is the third studio album by Colombian singer-songwriter Juanes, released on September 28, 2004.


== Re-releases ==
In 2005, a 'Tour Edition' of the album was released. This specially packaged re-release of Mi Sangre is an individually numbered, limited edition of 150,000 copies. Within its triple gatefold are two booklets — the CD's lyric book, a fold-out booklet with full credits of the current version, and many press quotes. The CD contains the regular album's 12 tracks, live versions of "A Dios le Pido," "La Camisa Negra," "Fotografía," and "Nada Valgo Sin Tu Amor". Bonus tracks include "La Paga", which features Taboo from The Black Eyed Peas, a remix of "La Camisa Negra," and the unreleased track "Lo Que Importa". "Lo Que Importa" was originally made for the album "Fijate Bien". The second disc is a DVD featuring all four videos shot for the album.
The 2005 Mexican double CD contains the regular album's 12 tracks too, but different bonus tracks and no DVD. Just like the regular Tour Edition, it contains bonus tracks "Lo Que Importa" and "La Paga", though the other bonus tracks are songs from his debut album Fíjate Bien; "Nada," "Fíjate Bien" and "Podemos Hacernos Daño". This edition also contains two other bonus tracks; an acoustic version of his first worldwide hit "A Dios le Pido" and a different remix of "La Camisa Negra."
As result of the big success after releasing "La Camisa Negra" at the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006, a Special European Tour edition was also released. The only difference between this version and the regular version is that the European version doesn't have the unreleased track "Lo Que Importa". The album also has a remix of "La Camisa Negra". In June 2006 a 2 disc limited edition was released in Germany. The first disc is the same as the Special European Tour edition. The second disc includes 6 songs performed live from the Shepherds Bush Empire in London.
The album was successful in the United States. As of 2019, the album has been certified 18× Platinum by the RIAA for selling 1,008,000 album-equivalent units in the country. In France, the album sold 300,000 copies as of 2014. Worldwide sales it estimated around 4 millions of copies.
