The 2010 UEFA European Under-17 Championship was the ninth edition of UEFA's European Under-17 Football Championship, held in Liechtenstein from 18 to 30 May 2010. The hosts decided not to field a team, fearing it would not be competitive enough for the tournament's prestige; their place was occupied by France, the best runner-up in the qualification's elite round. Germany was the 2009 title holder, but failed to qualify. In the final, England defeated Spain by 2â€“1, and achieved their first ever under-17 European title.
