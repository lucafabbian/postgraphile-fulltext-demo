Hichem Djait (Arabic: هشام جعيط; December 6, 1935 – June 1, 2021) was a prominent historian and scholar of Islam.


== Biography ==
Djait was born in 1935 in Tunis, Tunisia to a conservative upper-middle-class family. His father and some of his uncles and relatives were Islamic sages (or sheikhs), which made the name of the Djait family become traditionally associated with the Zeytouna Mosque as well as with Islamic Fiqh and Iftah (or jurisprudence). He completed his secondary education at Sadiki College, where he studied French, world literature, Western philosophy, Arabic, and Islamic Studies. This training made him discover Enlightenment thinkers and the ideals of the Renaissance and the Reformation, which were  different from the teachings of his family's conservative milieu. Djait later travelled to France, where he received the "Aggregation" diploma in History in 1962. His completed his doctoral defense in Arts and Humanities in Paris in 1981. 
He became an Emeritus Professor at the University of Tunis. He was also a visiting professor at the McGill University and the University of California at Berkeley. In addition to the numerous honorary titles and awards he received, Djait was member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts and was appointed president of the Tunisian Academy of Sciences, Letters, and Arts on February 17, 2012.He was a specialist in Medieval Islamic history and member of the International Scientific Institute for the General History of Africa edited by the UNESCO. In the many books he published in Tunisia and France, he mainly deals with subjects related to Arab-Islamic culture, history, and philosophy, as well as to the relationship between Islam and modernity and the place of Islam in the contemporary world. He believed that national identity and religious culture may be related but are not not mutually constitutive and supported  the political principle of laicite (secularism) "which will not be hostile to Islam, and does not draw its motivation from anti-Islamic feeling."  His 1989 publication The Great Fitna (or The Great Discord) came to be known as a seminal study and revolutionary reading of Islamic history following the death of Prophet Muhammad.The Great Fitna is often described by scholars and critics as the most influential reference on the subject.  Other works include Europe and Islam (1978), The Revelation, the Quran and the Prophecy (1986), The Crisis of Islamic Culture (2004) and a ground-breaking study entitled The Life of Muhammad, first published in French between 2001 and 2007 and released in English in 2012. The three volumes of the latter study, which cover the itinerary of the Prophet and the concomitant evolution of Islam, are subtitled "Revelation and Prophecy," "Predication in Mecca," and "The Prophet’s Life in Medina and the Triumph of Islam."
