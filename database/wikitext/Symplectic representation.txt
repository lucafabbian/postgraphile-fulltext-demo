In mathematical field of representation theory, a symplectic representation is a representation of a group or a Lie algebra on a symplectic vector space (V, ω) which preserves the symplectic form ω. Here ω is a nondegenerate skew symmetric bilinear form

  
    
      
        ω
        :
        V
        ×
        V
        →
        
          F
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega \colon V\times V\to \mathbb {F} }
  where F is the field of scalars. A representation of a group G preserves ω if

  
    
      
        ω
        (
        g
        ⋅
        v
        ,
        g
        ⋅
        w
        )
        =
        ω
        (
        v
        ,
        w
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (g\cdot v,g\cdot w)=\omega (v,w)}
  for all g in G and v, w in V, whereas a representation of a Lie algebra g preserves ω if

  
    
      
        ω
        (
        ξ
        ⋅
        v
        ,
        w
        )
        +
        ω
        (
        v
        ,
        ξ
        ⋅
        w
        )
        =
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \omega (\xi \cdot v,w)+\omega (v,\xi \cdot w)=0}
  for all ξ in g and v, w in V. Thus a representation of G or g is equivalently a group or Lie algebra homomorphism from G or g to the symplectic group Sp(V,ω) or its Lie algebra sp(V,ω)
If G is a compact group (for example, a finite group), and F is the field of complex numbers, then by introducing a compatible unitary structure (which exists by an averaging argument), one can show that any complex symplectic representation is a quaternionic representation. Quaternionic representations of finite or compact groups are often called symplectic representations, and may be identified using the Frobenius–Schur indicator.
