Dave Nathan, writing on Allmusic.com gave the album three stars out of five. Nathan said that it was "another excellent album" by Kent and it was "happily recommended". Nathan praised Kent's interplay with pianist David Newton on "Isn't This a Lovely Day" and "They Can't Take That Away From Me,", and guitarist Colin Oxley on "A Fine Romance". David Adler in All About Jazz wrote that Jim Tomlinson's tenor saxophone breaks on "He Loves and She Loves" are "exquisite". He praised Kent's delivery as "charming and infectious...She pours her heart out on two devastatingly sad numbers, "By Myself" and "I Guess I'll Have to Change My Plan"".
