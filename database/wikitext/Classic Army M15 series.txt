The Classic Army M15 series rifles are full-scale AEG replicas of the various M16-type and M4-type rifles currently in use by the United States armed forces. They are made by Classic Army.
All replicas feature metal receivers, strengthened gearsets and stiffer springs than AEG's from manufacturers such as Tokyo Marui, and also feature laser engraved "ArmaLite" trademarks, just like those found on the actual AR15 series weapons produced by ArmaLite.
