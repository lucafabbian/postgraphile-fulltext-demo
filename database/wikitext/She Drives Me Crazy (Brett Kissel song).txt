== Background ==
Kissel told The Boot that during the process of making his album Now or Never, "I [had written] "That's Country Music" and "Drink About Me," which was in the queue to be the first single, so I had a lot of powerful songs. I had "I'm Not Him, I'm Not Her," that I knew was gonna be on the album. I had "Coffee With Her." But I didn't have that uptempo pop banger, as I call it". Kissel remarked that on his way to write the song with fellow songwriters Emma-Lee and Karen Kosowski, he "was listening to pop music the whole way, just to get excited". He said after writing the song in 45 minutes, they were "feeling great about it, but it was so pop-heavy" and said "Oh my gosh, this is not a country song" and proceeded to add a major banjo riff to the song. Later that day, they wrote the track "Hummingbird" 
on a 1950s Gibson guitar so they "could tell the country gods that we still love country music".
