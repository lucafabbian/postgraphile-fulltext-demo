The knockout stages of the 2016 Copa do Brasil was played from August 24 to November 26, 2014. A total of 16 teams competed in the knockout stages.
A draw by CBF was held on August 2 to set the matches for this round. The 16 qualified teams were divided in two pots. Teams from pot 1 are the ones who competed at the 2016 Copa Libertadores and the best placed team in the 2015 Brazilian Série A not taking part in the 2016 Copa Libertadores plus the two highest CBF ranked teams qualified via the Third Round. Pot 2 is composed of the other teams that qualified through the Third Round. Each pot was divided into 4 pairs according to the CBF ranking. That division makes sure that each team within a pair will not face each other before the finals as they will be placed in opposite sides of the bracket. There was a draw to decide the home team of the round of 16. The following stages will have other draws to determine the order of the matches as the tournament advances.
