== Background and electorate ==


=== History of the Iowa caucus ===
Beginning in 1972, the Iowa caucuses have been characterized as the first major electoral test for both Democratic and Republican presidential contenders. Despite its strategic importance, between 1976 and 2016, only three out of eight winners of the Iowa caucuses went on to receive the Republican presidential nomination.


=== Republican electorate ===
Matthew Dallek, a professor of political history at George Washington University, has argued that the Iowa Republican caucuses effectively serve as "referendums on who is the most socially conservative candidate" in the Republican field.Commentators have noted the decisive role of Evangelical Christian caucusgoers in past contests. The victory of social conservatives Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, and Ted Cruz in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 Iowa caucuses, respectively, was credited to their strong support among evangelical voters.In 2016, it was noted by The Des Moines Register that almost half of likely Republican caucusgoers self-identify as evangelical or born-again Christians. In the 2016 Iowa Republican caucus, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas defeated eventual nominee Donald Trump by a 27.6% to 24.3% margin in what was considered an upset victory.

=== Declared candidates ===
Former President Donald Trump, former Governor of South Carolina and Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, former Governor of Arkansas Asa Hutchinson, Businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, radio host Larry Elder, and Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina are the only main contenders to officially announce their candidacy so far.


=== Potential candidates ===
Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis is expected to announce his candidacy on the May 25, 2023. Commentators have described DeSantis as Trump's closest rival in the Republican primary based on primary polling taken in 2022 and 2023. Former Vice President Mike Pence is also considering a candidacy for the Republican nomination.Other Republicans reportedly considering a candidacy include Governor Chris Sununu of New Hampshire; former Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey; former National Security Advisor John Bolton of Maryland; former Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan; former Representative Will Hurd of Texas; and Miami Mayor Francis X. Suarez of Florida.


== Campaign developments ==
In February 2023, the Trump campaign announced its Iowa campaign staff, with state representative Bobby Kaufmann and consultant Eric Branstad, the son of former Governor Terry Branstad, serving as senior advisors. In March 2023, Trump's campaign announced that it would hold an "America First Education Policy" event in Davenport on March 13, marking his first official campaign appearance in the state. On March 13, 2023, Trump made his first appearance in the state since announcing his candidacy, in which he spoke before a crowd in Davenport.Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis, who has not declared his candidacy, held a pair of events in the state on March 10, and was accompanied by Governor Kim Reynolds.
