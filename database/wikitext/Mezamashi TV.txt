In the first half of the 1990s, several news magazine shows of Fuji TV in the morning were discontinued after a short period because of low television ratings. The new show featured two presenters, Norikazu Otsuka and Akiko Yagi. Otsuka was a freelance presenter who had been a presenter at NHK. Mezamashi TV was first broadcast on April 1, 1994.
In 1997, Natsuko Kojima was appointed as an additional main newscaster. In 2003, Aya Takashima was appointed as a new main newscaster.
