The Bergische Museumsbahn is a heritage tram museum situated in the German city of Wuppertal. It operates its own tram line south of Wuppertal on original rails with original cars. Therefore, it's one of the smallest running tram systems in the world. Wuppertal still operates the "Schwebebahn", a unique overhead railway.


== Museum line ==

The museum line begins about 50 m east of the Kohlfurth bridge, where the depot may be found with its exhibition of vehicles and a bookshop. A track coming from the bridge is currently out of use. East of the depot the line winds its way south and then swings around in a 180° curve in order to follow the Kaltenbach valley north. The end of the line is currently at Greuel halt, although it has long been planned to work the section beyond that to Möschenborn.
Near Möschenborn halt the old line turns south again in order to reach Cronenberg.
The route has a height difference of about 150 metres, which means that it has an average incline of 5%. The largest part of the route cuts through a wood and is therefore typical of the former overground tramway network. On the other hand the route does not really have any town sections. There are seven stops.
