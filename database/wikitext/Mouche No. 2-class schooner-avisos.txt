The Mouche No. 2-class schooner-avisos were a class of twenty-eight 1-gun dispatch or advice boats of the French Navy, all built between 1808 and 1810. Jean Baudry designed the vessels based on the draught of Villaret. Baudry may have been the builder on the schooners launched at Bayonne.

Lloyd's List reported that on 27 August "the Mouche French National Schooner of one gun, four swivels, and 24 men, from Bayonne to the Havannah, with Dispatches, arrived at Plymouth, 27 instant, Prize to the Cossack SW." Some French records suggest that she was captured on 19 August 1808 in the Antilles. The prize money notice in the London Gazette gives the date of capture as 5 August.

In late 1808 she was under the command of enseigne de vaisseau auxiliaire Sorel, and carrying dispatches from Saint-Domingue to Pasajes, and then returning to Bayonne.

In the action, the lieutenant de vaiseau commanding Mouche No.4 was killed. The prize money notice credited Resistance and HMS Arethusa with the capture, as well as that of four other merchant vessels on the 26th and 27th. It also gave the name of Mouche No.4's commander as "Sorrel".


== Mouche No.5 ==
She was launched at Bayonne on 25 June 1808. She was initially under the command of enseigne de vaisseau auxiliaire Gautier. French records indicate that she was destroyed on 9 March 1809 to prevent capture. Resistance's crew received head money for her destruction.

In early 1810 HMS Hazard took part in the invasion of Guadeloupe. During the invasion, Hazard led the fleet into Anse de Barque where she saw a French schooner anchored under the batteries and on fire. Robertson and a boarding party of marines boarded the burning schooner Mouche despite fire from the shore batteries that were trying either to sink them or the schooner. By the time Robertson was able to board the schooner part of her deck had burnt away; while the boarding party was cutting away her masts the intense heat discharged all her guns.
