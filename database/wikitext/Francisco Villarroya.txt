== Club career ==
Born in Zaragoza, Villarroya made his professional debut with hometown's Real Zaragoza, appearing in one La Liga game in the 1984–85 season (a 4–0 away loss against FC Barcelona) but being almost exclusively connected with the reserves for three years.In the summer of 1990, after helping the Aragonese to two consecutive top-ten finishes in the top division – fifth in the 1988–89 campaign, with the subsequent qualification for the UEFA Cup – whilst only missing a total of two matches, he signed with Real Madrid, being occasionally utilised as left-back during his four-year spell and being the capital side's first choice prior to the signing of Brazilian Roberto Carlos, battling for the position with Mikel Lasa.After just 13 league appearances in his last two years at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, following the arrival of manager Benito Floro, Villarroya joined Deportivo de La Coruña, being relatively used and adding another Copa del Rey to his trophy cabinet. Still in the top tier, he then represented Sporting de Gijón, suffering relegation at the end of his second season.Villarroya closed out his career at the age of 32 after one year with CD Badajoz in the Segunda División, amassing top-flight totals of 276 matches and nine goals over 14 seasons.
