== History ==
The school was founded in 1917 on the city's south side along the San Antonio River near the King William neighborhood. It was named for George Washington Brackenridge.  The original three-story brick structure was demolished and replaced with today's shorter, more sprawling structure in 1974.
That year, the school was renamed in honor of Phillis Wheatley, the first published African-American poet, a woman taken in childhood from West Africa, enslaved and taken to Boston, and eventually freed. In 1988, bowing to some alumni concerns, the school's original name was restored.
