The 1941 municipal election was held November 12, 1941 to elect a mayor and five aldermen to sit on Edmonton City Council and four trustees to sit on the public school board, while four trustees were acclaimed to the separate school board.
There were ten aldermen on city council, but five of the positions were already filled: James Ogilvie, Sidney Bowcott, Athelstan Bissett (SS), Sidney Parsons, and Frederick John Mitchell were all elected to two-year terms in 1940 and were still in office.
There were seven trustees on the public school board, but three of the positions were already filled: Izena Ross, E M Gunderson, and W G McConachie had been acclaimed to two-year terms in 1940 and were still in office.  The same was true of the separate board, where Adrien Crowe (SS), James Oâ€™Hara, and J O Pilon were continuing.
