"It's Over" is a 1966 song written and originally performed by Jimmie Rodgers. He released it as a single in 1966, with "Anita, You're Dreaming" on the flip side.
Jimmie Rodgers recalled:

I was with Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass at Carnegie Hall in New York, and there was a girl there at the show. She was standing outside crying and we began to talk. She had just broken up with her boyfriend. I asked if she was okay. She said, "No, my boyfriend and I broke up today and it's over." I went back to my room and wrote "It's Over." I never had Elvis in mind to do it when I wrote the song.
