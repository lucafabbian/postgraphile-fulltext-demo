== Breach of Standards in Public Life ==
In 2020, The Commissioner for Standards in Public Life found that Farrugia Portelli may have given an improper advantage to a private firm selling citizenship by investment schemes. Minister Farrugia Portelli, who at the time was a Parliamentary Secretary with responsibility for these schemes, appeared in all three videos together with officials from the government agencies that administer the schemes and representatives of the law firm itself. All three videos were shot in Castille. The Commissioner held that “there is a fine line between promoting a Government scheme and giving preferential treatment to a particular agent. In my opinion, this line has been crossed in the case under consideration.”
