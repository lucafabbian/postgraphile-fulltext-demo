Fitzroy was an electoral district of the Legislative Assembly in the Australian state of Queensland.The district was based in central Queensland, west of Rockhampton. It included the towns of Baralaba, Blackwater, Duaringa, Dysart, Mount Morgan and Wowan as well as some of Rockhampton's outer suburbs. The electorate was first contested in 1992. An earlier district based in the same region was also called Fitzroy. It was first contested in 1888 and abolished in 1960.
In 2008, Fitzroy was abolished—with effect at the 2009 state election—as a result of a redistribution undertaken by the Electoral Commission of Queensland. Its former territory and voters were divided between the districts of Callide, Gregory, Mirani and Rockhampton.
