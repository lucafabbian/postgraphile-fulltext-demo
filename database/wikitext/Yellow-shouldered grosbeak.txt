== Taxonomy ==
The yellow-shouldered grosbeak was formally described in 1867 by the American amateur ornithologist George Newbold Lawrence. He coined the Latin name Pytilus (Caryothrautes) humeralis. The species was moved to its own genus Parkerthraustes in 1997 by James Van Remsen Jr. The genus name was chosen to honour the memory of the American ornithologist Theodore A. Parker III who had died in an airplane accident. The specific epithet humeralis is Late Latin meaning "of the shoulders".The yellow-shouldered grosbeak was traditionally considered a member of the cardinal family Cardinalidae. It was moved to the tanager family based on the results of a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2007. It is placed in the subfamily Orchesticinae with the brown tanager in its own genus Orchesticus. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.
