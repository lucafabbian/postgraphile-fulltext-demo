Congregation Adas Emuno is a Reform synagogue in Leonia, New Jersey.

The congregation was founded in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1871. They moved into a new synagogue in 1873, and received a donation of a Torah scroll at that time. In 1883  they erected a small new synagogue building, with a mix of Gothic and Romanesque styles. That edifice is the oldest synagogue building still standing in New Jersey, though it was subsequently used for some years as a church, and is now a residential building.In 1971, the congregation moved to Leonia, to a brick building purchased from the Holy Trinity Lutheran Church.Adas Emuno owns two cemeteries. The older, smaller one is a small section of Hoboken Cemetery (but was originally part of the adjacent Flower Hill Cemetery). The larger, and slightly more recent cemetery is sited in North Arlington, NJ, across Belleville Turnpike from the Arlington Memorial Park. Adas Emuno may have been the first organization to use that cemetery, though many Jewish organizations opened additional sections within it afterwards. While the main gate for the cemetery shows Hebrew year 5669 (generally corresponding to 1909), there are gravestones dating as early as 1899 within the section.
