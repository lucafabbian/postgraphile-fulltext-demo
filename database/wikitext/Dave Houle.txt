David C. Houle was born in 1953 in Dugway, Utah. Houle is the winningest high school coach in the United States, with over 1,000 victories in girls' basketball, track and cross-country, winning 68 state championships and 7 national championships. 
Houle began coaching in 1965, aged 12, and is a member of the National High School Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Houle amassed more state championships than any other high school coach, and was named by USA Today as "The Most Successful High School Coach in America".He helped Mountain View High School (Utah)'s athletes, in boys' and girls' track and cross-country, and girls' basketball, earn 68 state championships, as well as numerous region trophies. After winning the boys' cross-country national title in 2002, he was named the Coach of the Year. His athletes were known for their love and support towards their opponents, and for years of service to the Orem City community. 
Houle resigned in 2006 after allegations of inappropriate conduct while on a road trip with his basketball team. Houle is reported to have allowed two girls, who had allegedly been sick, to sleep in his room while he walked in the lobby of the hotel all night to keep them away from the rest of the team.  Several rules were violated in allowing the members of his team to use his hotel room.  Despite being aggressively recruited by other schools throughout his coaching reign, Houle opted to stick to what he loved best and later worked at a nearby private school.
In his final days of coaching, Houle said, "I'm 52, and I hope to die at 92, so I have 40 good years left of coaching."
Houle currently lives in American Fork, Utah.
