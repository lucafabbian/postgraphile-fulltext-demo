== History ==
Bijutsukantoshokanmae Station was opened on April 13, 1924 along with the opening of the Fukushima Iizaka Tramway (福島飯坂電車軌道, Fukushima Iizaka Dennsha Kidō) as Moriai Station (森合駅). In 1942, due to the section of track between Fukushima and Moriai being changed to dedicated tramway track, Soneda and Moriai stations were shut down. Moriai Station was reopened in a new location. It was renamed to its present name in 1991.
