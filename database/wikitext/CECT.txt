CECT is one of the many brands of cellular phones manufactured in China. CECT offered unauthorized clones or replicas of the Apple Inc. iPhone and various Nokia cell phones manufactured in China and sold at a fraction of the price of the original. At least one reseller was subject to legal demands from Apple Inc. CECT also distributed Palm phones in China.


== iPhone clones ==
The CECT iPhone "clones" had been described as one of a growing number of MediaTek-powered iPhone clones. Two of the differences between the clones and the Apple iPhone are that the "clones" normally  have smaller-resolution resistive touch screens (instead of capacitive) and dual SIM card slots. Newer models however, featured capacitive touch screens.


=== CECT ===
CECT is one of the largest China-based mobile phone manufacturer. While most of the phones listed below origins are unknown, they are believed to be produced by CECT. One of CECT's original phones was the CECT T689.


=== HiPhone ===
The HiPhone T32 is the only model in the Hiphone series to offer Wi-Fi. In many of the clone models, the only difference is firmware versions. Not all HiPhones are labeled by the manufacturer; some are labeled only by the software version w006 or w009.Please note the term "Sciphone" is often used to reference clone phones, because Sciphone is the manufacturer of the i68, i9, and more recently the i9+++.
