Hero is a fictional character in William Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing. She is the daughter of Leonato, a governor in Messina, and cousin to Beatrice. In the play, Hero falls in love with Claudio, who, under the influence of Don John, wrongfully accuses her of adultery causing her to fake her death. Hero is ultimately proven innocent and reconciles with Claudio at the play's conclusion.
Hero's origins are possibly from The Faerie Queen, Orlando Furioso, and Matteo Bandello's Novelle. The Hero/Claudio plot has been criticized for its incoherence in tone with the Beatrice/Benedick plot and has led to Much Ado About Nothing sometimes being called a tragicomedy. Especially in the 20th- and 21st-centuries, Shakespeare's depiction of Hero has been criticized by feminist readings of the play.
Many actors have portrayed Hero on stage and screen including Ellen Terry. Kate Beckinsale, Jennifer Gould, Billie Piper, and Jillian Morgese.


== Origins ==
A version of the Hero-Claudio plot appears in Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in Book II, Canto iv. Ludovico Ariosto's story of Ariodante and Genevra in Orlando Furioso is a likely source for Spenser's tale. It also influenced Shakespeare's interpretation of Hero and Claudio, though Melinda Gough identifies the Hero-Claudio plot more strongly with Aristoto's tale of Ruggiero and Alcin. However, Shakespeare may not have read Aristoto directly and possibly only had access to his works through translation.Scholars have also located the origins of the Hero-Claudio plot within Matteo Bandello's twenty-second story of part one of his Novelle, which deals with the character of Fenicia. In this story, Fenicia is defamed because her lover overhears another man talking about her as if she was his mistress. Additionally, Fenicia's father is named Messer Lionato de' Lionati, a name which resembles Hero's father's. Bandello's story may be influenced by Chariton's Greek romance, Chaeras and Callirrhoe, which Shakespeare may had have access to through a French translation.


=== Name origins ===

The name Hero comes from the Greek ἥρως (heros) meaning "hero". Shakespeare's choice of the name Hero may have been a reference to Christopher Marlowe's Hero and Leander, which features the line, "Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight."


== Role in the play ==
Hero lives with her father, Leonato, and cousin, Beatrice, in Messina, Italy. At the play's outset, Leonato welcomes a group of soldiers to his house, including the young soldier Claudio. Claudio is immediately smitten with Hero. Don Pedro offers to woo her in his place and does so, disguised at Leonato's party. Claudio and Hero plan to marry in a week. Following along with Don Pedro's plan, Hero helps to gull Beatrice into thinking Benedick is in love with her.

At her wedding to Claudio, Claudio, misled by Don Jon into thinking Hero (actually a disguised Margaret) spent the night before the wedding with Borachio, accuses Hero of being unfaithful. Being completely innocent of all accusations, Hero makes a few brief attempts to defend herself and ultimately faints. When she regains consciousness, the friar suggests that Hero fake her death to give the truth time to come to light and have Hero's accusers change their opinions of her. Dogberry discovers Don Jon's plot and proves Hero's innocence. Leonato invents a niece for Claudio to marry. The niece is actually a veiled Hero who reveals herself as the two marry.


== Analysis ==
Some critics have claimed that the Hero/Claudio plot is tonally inconsistent with the often light-hearted comedy Beatrice/Benedick plot. The darkness of Claudio's treatment of Hero has led some to label Much Ado a "trage-comedy". More contemporary critics have used this same argument to suggest that Much Ado is a "serious comedy", despite its flippant title.


=== Convention ===
The coupling of Hero and Claudio has been described by some scholars as the play's more conventional couple, in comparison to Beatrice and Benedick. Claudio's wooing of Hero is from afar and places him in the conventional Petrarchan position of the lover admiring his love as on a pedestal.


=== Feminist critiques ===
In Elizabeth Griffith's 1775 text, Morality of Shakespeare's Drama Illustrated, Griffith writes that the slander of Hero was "so very irksome a theme, that it disgusts me to dwell upon it." It was not until the late 19th-century that criticism of the patriarchal mistreatment of Hero reemerged. Grace Latham, in 1891, detested how Hero's independence and self-assertion are taken away from her. 20th-century feminist readings of Much Ado follow in Latham's view and often criticize the ways in which Hero and Beatrice are both silenced as they become wives.


=== Comparison to other Shakespeare characters ===
Scholars have noted that the sudden attraction in the Hero/Claudio plot shares certain similarities with Shakespeare's earlier play, Romeo and Juliet. Additionally, both Hero and Juliet are advised to fake their deaths by friars, though with wildly different outcomes. Martin Mueller identifies Hero as part of Shakespeare's "sleeping beauties", a group of female Shakespeare characters also including Hermione, Desdemona, and Juliet, whose "deaths are subject to doubt and draw attention to the poet's freedom to dispose of their fate one way or another."
