It had 7 teachers (6 teachers and 1 principal who also taught the F class; they were strict but they loved us), with 30 or more students per classroom, with 1 janitor-cleaner. It was without heating (in winter our feet were shivering), without a canteen (for 2 pennies you could buy -whoever had- 1 pretzel from a hawker with a bag that came to the bars). There was sand in the yard, in which we played chase (no balls). The building was as it is today, having the same yard as the 8th grade across the street-which they got along with very well "
