Day's application for Exceptional Player Status was granted by Hockey Canada on March 21, 2013, making him eligible to be drafted a year early in the 2013 OHL Priority Selection. Day was the fourth player to be granted the exemption, allowing him to start his major junior hockey career as a 15-year-old. The other players to have previously received the exemption are John Tavares in 2005, Aaron Ekblad in 2011 and Connor McDavid in 2012. He was drafted fourth overall in the OHL Priority draft.
In the 2016–17 season, on October 19, 2016, Day was acquired by Memorial Cup hosts, the Windsor Spitfires from the Mississauga Steelheads in exchange for draft picks. Gearing towards the playoffs with the Spitfires, on March 8, 2017, Day agreed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the New York Rangers. He would win the Memorial Cup with the Spitfires later that season.

After a slow start in the first six games he was demoted to the Maine Mariners.

On May 30, 2020, Day was placed on unconditional waivers by the Rangers for the purposes of contract termination. He cleared waivers the following day and the remaining year of his contract was terminated. As a free agent on July 17, 2020, Day was signed to a one-year, two-way contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning.He made his NHL debut with the Lightning on December 28, 2021, against the Montreal Canadiens.
