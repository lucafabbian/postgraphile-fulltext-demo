Theodore William Chaundy (19 January 1889 – 14 April 1966) was an English mathematician who introduced Burchnall–Chaundy theory.
Chaundy was born to widowed businessman John Chaundy and his second wife Sarah Pates in their shop-cum-home at 49 Broad Street in Oxford. John had eight children, one of whom died as a toddler, with his late first wife and died barely a year after Chaundy was born. The Chaundy home along Broad Street has since been demolished.Chaundy attended Oxford High School for Boys and read mathematics at Balliol College, Oxford on a scholarship. In 1912 he became a lecturer at Oxford and later named a Fellow of Christ Church, Oxford. He married Hilda Weston Dott (1890–1986) in 1920. They had five children and thirteen grandchildren.
