Italma (acronym of Italiano Alluminio Magnesio) is an aluminium alloy. It was produced by A.S.A. (Alluminio Soc. Anonima) and was introduced shortly after World War II in order to being used in the new coinage of the Italian lira, which lasted until the adoption of the Italian euro coins in 2002. It comprised 96.2% aluminium, 3.5% magnesium, and 0.3% manganese.
