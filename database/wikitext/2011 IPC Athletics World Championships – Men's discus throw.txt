The men's discus throw at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships was held at the QEII Stadium from 22 to 28 January.
In the Men's discus throw F42, held on January 27, the Gold was originally won by Fanie Lombaard of South Africa. However, he tested positive for Probenecid in a urine sample provided on 27 January 2011. The prohibited substance had been prescribed to him because of a medical problem, but he did not have a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) suspended him for a year (from January 27), and fined him 1,500 euros. The IPC redistributed the medals.
