Mark(ing) your own homework (where "your" is often substituted with "their", "one's", "its", "his" or "her") is a British expression used in political discourse, the study of organisational behaviour and in everyday life. The expression implies that whenever a person or group self-assesses and/or self regulates their own work they will usually treat it more favorably than if it were assessed by an independent person or group.
