Choranthias salmopunctatus, the salmon-spotted jewelfish, is a species of marine ray-finned fish in the family Serranidae, the groupers and sea bass. It is endemic to Brazil where a small population of Anthias salmopunctatus have been spotted near St. Peter and St. Paul's archipelago. Upon resurfacing after a 30-year disappearance, this population of fish can now be found aggregating in relatively small groups.
