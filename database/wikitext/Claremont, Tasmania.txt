Claremont is a rural / residential locality in the local government areas (LGA) of Glenorchy (75%) and Derwent Valley (25%) in the Hobart and South-east LGA regions of Tasmania. The locality is about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) north of the town of Glenorchy. The 2021 census recorded a population of 8,397 for the state suburb of Claremont.


== History ==
Claremont was gazetted as a locality in 1960.
It is named after Claremont House, which was built in the 1830s by local settler Henry Bilton, who named it after one of the royal homes of England.
Claremont was the home of an Army training facility during World War I, but this was moved to Brighton some time before World War II. At that time Claremont consisted of only a few houses and farms. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, public housing was built in the suburb (as happened in the rest of the City of Glenorchy).


== Cadbury's Estate ==

Following the completion of the newly constructed chocolate factory, the Cadbury's Estate was established at Claremont in 1922 as a means to facilitate housing for Cadbury factory workers. Based upon the model village of Cadbury's Bournville estate in Birmingham, the estate embodied the company's Quaker ideology, providing housing for workers, shops, sporting facilities, a school, a Friends meeting house and parkland, complete with purple benches.
Bound by Bilton Bay to the north and Windermere Bay to the south upon the River Derwent, the 246-acre (100 ha) site, comprised the model village occupying 108 acres (44 ha) of the peninsula, the factory covering 41 acres (17 ha), recreational and shore reserves consisting of 58 acres (23 ha), and supporting infrastructure occupying a further 43 acres (17 ha).Within the estate are various roads and buildings containing historical industry namesakes, such as Bournville Road, named after Cadbury's original worker's estate. MacRobertson’s Road pays tribute to MacRobertson's, the Australian company which created Cherry Ripe, Old Gold and Freddo Frog, acquired by Cadburys in 1967.
Today, the Cadbury's Estate has a rich history with eighteen heritage-listed buildings located on the site, including the former Claremont Primary School.
