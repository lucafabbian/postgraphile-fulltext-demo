== Background ==
On August 12, 2014, Canadian rapper Drake released a remix to the original version of Makonnen's song, titled "Club Goin' Up on a Tuesday". On August 31, 2014, it was reported Makonnen signed a recording contract with Drake's record label, OVO Sound. Drake changed the song title to "Tuesday". Drake got in touch with Sonny Digital; the rapper released the remix two days later. On this release, Makonnen said "It was great. I was excited."


== Reception ==
The website Pitchfork awarded a "Best New Track" mention to Drake's remix of the song. In the track review, Patrick Fallon concluded "Somehow, this summertime sleeper hit has become a self-fulfilling prophecy: iLoveMakonnen worked tirelessly to get to this point in his career, and now with a proper success... he can finally party like it's a Tuesday." "Tuesday" placed second in the magazine's year-end list. The song was also named 2nd best song of 2014 by Spin, noting "There's never been a radio hit quite like it before, with the cadence and brio of hip-hop, the musicality and patience of R&B — good R&B, at that — and the strobe-lit sonics and spaciousness of EDM." It was also listed at number 21 on Fader's list of the 116 best tracks of the year. In January 2015, "Tuesday" was ranked at number six on The Village Voice's annual year-end Pazz & Jop critics' poll. The remix featuring Drake received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.
