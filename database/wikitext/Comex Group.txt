== History ==
The Sherwin-Williams Company (SHW), the largest U.S. paint retailer, agreed in November 2012 to acquire closely held Consorcio Comex SA de CV for about $2.34 billion including debt to gain Mexico's largest paint maker. The deal was rejected by Mexico's Comisión Federal de Competencia in November 2013 for antitrust purposes, and a result of such, PPG Industries has agreed to buy Comex for $2.3 billion  Sherwin-Williams was still able to purchase Comex' operations in the United States and Canada for $165 million. After the failed bid in Mexico, and before the take-over by PPG, Comex sued Sherwin-Williams for not trying hard enough to seal the deal.In July 2015, after the photo of president Enrique Peña Nieto showing his height difference next to Felipe VI of Spain made the international headlines, Comex released on its Twitter account a photoshopped photo of the Mexican president standing on one of its paint pots with the text "una pintura de altura" (a paint of stature). After the post got widely retweeted, the company deleted it and made an official apology, arguing that the photo had not been approved before it went live.
