== History ==
The first formal mention of the city of Schönberg came in the year 1219, and shortly after became the residence of the Bishopric of Ratzeburg. Schönberg was occupied by the Soviets and became a part of East Germany. There's a Soviet graveyard a little distance before the city's train station. The former municipality Lockwisch was merged into Schönberg in January 2019.


== Education ==
The largest school within the city, Ernst-Barlach Gymnasium, is located on the Oberteich and contains grades 5-13 with 650 students. The school was subjugated to many different names and uses throughout its history since its opening in 1846. Under the German Democratic Republic (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) the school was reformed to hold grades 9-12 and was changed twice as the Erweiterte and Rudolf Hartmann Polytechnic Oberschules. In 1991 with the fall of East Germany, it was changed again to Gymnasium Schönberg until 2001 when students voted it to its current name.
The town also gives a grundschule or primary school, as well as a regionale schule.
