In traffic flow modeling, the intelligent driver model (IDM) is a time-continuous car-following model for the simulation of freeway and urban traffic. It was developed by Treiber, Hennecke and Helbing in 2000 to improve upon results provided with other "intelligent" driver models such as Gipps' model, which loses realistic properties in the deterministic limit.


== Model definition ==
As a car-following model, the IDM describes the dynamics of the positions and velocities of single vehicles. For vehicle 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  ,

            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\alpha }}
   denotes its position at time 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  , and 
  
    
      
        
          v
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle v_{\alpha }}
   its velocity. Furthermore, 
  
    
      
        
          l
          
            α
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle l_{\alpha }}
   gives the length of the vehicle. To simplify notation, we define the net distance 
  
    
      
        
          s

  , where 
  
    
      
        α
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha -1}
   refers to the vehicle directly in front of vehicle 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
  , and the velocity difference, or approaching rate,

    {\displaystyle \Delta v_{\alpha }:=v_{\alpha }-v_{\alpha -1}}
  . For a simplified version of the model, the dynamics of vehicle 
  
    
      
        α
      
    
    {\displaystyle \alpha }
   are then described by the following two ordinary differential equations:

  For this example, the following values are given for the equation's parameters, in line with the original calibrated model.

The two ordinary differential equations are solved using Runge–Kutta methods of orders 1, 3, and 5 with the same time step, to show the effects of computational accuracy in the results.

This comparison shows that the IDM does not show extremely irrealistic properties such as negative velocities or vehicles sharing the same space even for from a low order method such as with the Euler's method (RK1). However, traffic wave propagation is not as accurately represented as in the higher order methods, RK3 and RK 5. These last two methods show no significant differences, which lead to conclude that a solution for IDM reaches acceptable results from RK3 upwards and no additional computational requirements would be needed. Nonetheless, when introducing heterogeneous vehicles and both jam distance parameters, this observation could not suffice.
