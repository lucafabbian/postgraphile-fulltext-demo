The International Environmental Design Contest (IEDC)  is a competition hosted by the WERC Consortium and The Institute for Energy & The Environment at New Mexico State University. It is an annual event in which student teams prepare written, oral, poster, and bench-scale model presentations in response to design tasks. The student solutions are judged by industry and academic professionals.


== Description ==
The International Environmental Design Contest has been held annually at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces since 1991. The Contest occurs in April and draws college students from around the United States and the world. In the past, the contest has also held concurrent high school design contests.

In response to design tasks posed by the hosting organization, student teams prepare written, oral, poster, and bench-scale model presentations. The design tasks are "based on real-world environmental challenges" and usually relate to water and renewable energy. The challenges are developed with assistance from government agencies, industrial affiliates, and academic partners. These assisting entities also serve as judges for the final competition. Judging criteria includes: process feasibility and practicality, cost analysis, community relations and outreach, adherence to various applicable regulations and permitting, safety considerations, and a discussion of potential waste streams.

Students consider alternative solutions to a given “environmental challenge” from all aspects including technical, legal, health, socioeconomic and community related issues. Other considerations include regulatory guidelines, public opinion, and cost. Winning solutions merit cash prizes and traveling trophies.The Contest is hosted by the Institute for Energy & the Environment at New Mexico State University. The Institute for Energy & the Environment includes: WERC, a Consortium for Environmental Education and Technology Development, Southwest Technology Development Institute, a renewable energy research and development group, and Carlsbad Environmental Monitoring and Research Center, a nuclear waste-management and monitoring center.
The contest is a sponsored event. In 2007, it was sponsored by Intel, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the American Water Works Association and Research Foundation. In 2011, the State of New Mexico, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Intel Corporation, the Office of Naval Research, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration acted as sponsors for the event.


== Tasks ==
In 2003, there were 14 tasks. In 2011, there were seven. Tasks require students "to present design proposals, oral and poster presentations, and working bench-scale models to verify the design, functionality, and cost-effectiveness of their proposed solutions." The tasks are developed from input given by government agencies, industrial affiliates, academic partners to the Institute for Energy and the Environment.Example Design Contest tasks from 2007:

Develop a photovoltaic (solar panel) system performance indicator to determine that a residential utility-interactive PV system is operating properly and that the AC power output is following the solar power available to the PV array.
Develop an inland desalination operation and disposal system for water)in rural, isolated communities to demonstrate a low-cost, simple and reliable system.
Convert a biomass resource to useful forms of energy and other products to demonstrate options using biogas or liquids.


== Awards ==
Cash prizes and traveling trophies are awarded at the Design Contest. Individual awards are also distributed at the event. Awards include Outstanding Award for best oral and paper presentation, the Terry McManus Award, the Intel Innovation award, and first and second place for the various tasks. The following is a listing of Design Contest Awards and their recipients at previous years' competitions:
