In Greek mythology, Sthenelus (Ancient Greek: Σθένελος, Sthenelos, "strong one, forcer"; derived from sthenos, "strength, might, force") was a king of Tiryns and Mycenae, and the son of Perseus who founded the latter city.


== Family ==
Sthenelus' mother was Andromeda, an Ethiopian princess as daughter of King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia. He was the brother of Perses, Alcaeus, Heleus, Mestor, Electryon, Cynurus, Gorgophone and Autochthoe. By Nicippe, sister of Atreus and Thyestes, Sthenelus became the father of Eurystheus, Alcyone and Medusa (Astymedusa).


== Mythology ==
Sthenelus exiled his nephew Amphitryon, born to his brother Alcaeus, from Mycenae for having murdered Electryon, Sthenelus' other brother. (Amphitryon was also the husband of his niece, Alcmene, and she joined him in his exile.) As heir, Sthenelus was the successor to the throne of Mycenae. He was in turn succeeded by his son Eurystheus, born to him and his wife Nicippe, and eventually killed by Hyllus, son of Heracles and Deianira.
