Shibakawa was located in the far eastern portion of former Suruga Province, and was largely tenryō territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate in the Edo period. During the cadastral reform of the early Meiji period in 1889, the area was reorganized into two villages (Yuzuno, Shibafuji) within Fuji District and one village (Uchibo Village) within Ihara District. Uchibo and Shibafuji merged in 1955 to form Fujihara Village, which was renamed Shibakawa in 1956 after it annexed neighboring Yuzuno Village.

The economy of Shibakawa is largely based on agriculture, and tourism. The town also serves as a bedroom community for the industrial zones in neighboring Fuji.
