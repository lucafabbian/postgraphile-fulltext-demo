Nijgh & Van Ditmar is a Dutch publishing company, founded in 1837. In 2014 it was acquired by Singel Uitgeverijen.


== History ==
The company was founded in 1837 in Rotterdam by Henricus Nijgh, who originally started a bookstore but quickly discovered that the publishing business was profitable as well. Nijgh was also the founder, in 1843, of the Rotterdamsch staats-, handels-, nieuws- en advertentieblad, which later became the Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant. In 1864 he teamed up with Willem Nicolaas Josua van Ditmar, whose last name was added to the firm's name in 1870.
