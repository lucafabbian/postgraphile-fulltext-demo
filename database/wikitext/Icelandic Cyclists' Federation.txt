In 2008 after the financial crash a Facebook group called Samtök um bíllausan lífsstíl (which translates to "The association for a car-free lifestyle"), was formed and then turned into an organisation with an elected board. There has been some co-operation and member overlap between the two.
In 2014 a separate Icelandic federation for sports cycling was formed, Hjólreiðasamband Íslands, which is a formal affiliate  of the National Olympic and Sports Association of Iceland.
