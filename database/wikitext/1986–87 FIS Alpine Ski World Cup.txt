The 21st World Cup season began in August 1986 in Argentina for men, resumed in late November, and concluded in March 1987 in Sarajevo.  The overall champions were Pirmin Zurbriggen and Maria Walliser, both of Switzerland, who each won for the second time.  Two-time women's overall World Cup champion Erika Hess of Switzerland retired at the end of the season.
Along with the elimination of the Combined discipline championship, all of the combined races on the schedule were eliminated except for the traditional two combineds at Wengen, Switzerland (the Lauberhorn) and Kitzb√ºhel, Austria (the Hahnenkamm) for the men and one at Mellau, Austria for the women.  However, under new rules, points were only awarded to skiers who finished in the top 30 in each of the downhill and slalom; as a result, only two men earned points.  In addition, despite the presence of two tiebreakers, the ladies' Giant Slalom discipline ended in a tie.
A break in the schedule was for the 1987 World Championships, held in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, between January 27 and February 8, 1987.
