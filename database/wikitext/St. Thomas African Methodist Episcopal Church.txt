It has a steeply pitched gable-front roof.  The interior has an open space with a pulpit, with three sections of pews.  It is one of the last remaining buildings of a historically African-American neighborhood and was the largest and only brick building in the neighborhood.It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 7, 2000.
