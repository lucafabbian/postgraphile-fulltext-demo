Ținutul Argeș (or Ținutul Bucegi) was one of the ten Romanian ținuturi ("lands") founded in 1938, after King Carol II initiated an institutional reform by modifying the 1923 Constitution and the law of territorial administration. Named after the Argeș River and extending over historical areas of Wallachia and parts of Transylvania (Székely Land), it had its capital in the city of Bucharest. Ținutul Argeș ceased to exist following the territorial losses of Romania (Second Vienna Award) and the king's abdication in 1940.

The coat of arms consisted of ten bars, five of azure and five of argent, representing the former ten counties (județe) of Greater Romania (71 in total in 1938) included in it, charged with or eagle wings displayed facing dexter with an or Latin cross in the beak (elements taken from Wallachia's historical coat of arms) standing over five peaks argent representing the Bucegi Mountains.
