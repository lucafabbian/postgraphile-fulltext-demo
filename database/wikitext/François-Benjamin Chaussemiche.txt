François-Benjamin Chaussemiche (June 4, 1864 – 1945) was a French architect.
Chaussemiche was born in Tours, and in 1883 entered the École des Beaux-Arts where he became a student and later colleague of Victor Laloux. He won the Prix de Rome for architecture in 1893, and served as chief architect of the Palace of Versailles from 1917-1924, during which time he created the Parc botanique de Jussieu (now the Arboretum de Chèvreloup).
