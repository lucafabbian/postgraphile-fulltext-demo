Springs of Life (春到人间) is a Singaporean Chinese drama which aired in 2002. It was produced following the success of Wok of Life. Unusual for a locally produced period drama at that time, the theme song's introduction is in a rock and roll style.


== Synopsis ==
The story begins in the 1950s and spans about three decades. A young entrepreneur Dapao is on a quest to learn the secret of a special medicinal oil in hopes of striking the jackpot. Meanwhile, a pair of singing sisters try to make their way in showbiz.

== Reception ==
Springs of Life was extremely popular and broke the record held by Love Me, Love Me Not for viewership ratings.


== Notes ==
The 2012 anniversary drama Joys of Life (花样人间) follows a similar theme to Springs of Life and Wok of Life and also stars Chew Chor Meng and Huang Wenyong. Only Chew has starred in all three dramas. Unlike many typical period dramas produced by MediaCorp such as The Awakening or The Little Nyonya, these "ren jian" (人间) period dramas are much more lighthearted and humorous.
Many veteran artistes from the SBC and TCS era made guest appearances or were part of the supporting cast, such as Madeline Chu (朱乐玲) and Tammy Chow (周黛兰). Veteran Chinese actress Cheng Pei-pei also joined the cast.


== 2003 Accolades ==
The Star Awards 2003 was generally dominated by another popular long-running drama Holland V  but Springs of Life managed several nominations.
