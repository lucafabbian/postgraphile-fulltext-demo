The 2018 Utah House of Representatives election was held in the U.S. state of Utah on November 6, 2018, to elect members to the House of Representatives of the 63rd Utah State Legislature. A primary election was held in several districts on June 26, 2018. The election coincided with the election for U.S. Senate and other elections.
The Utah Republican Party won a majority of seats, keeping the Republican majority that they have held since 1977. The new legislature convened on January 28, 2019.


== Background ==
Republicans have held the Utah State House of Representative since 1977, and the chamber was not considered competitive in 2018. However, as was the case in many states, Democrats were encouraged to see the purported "Blue Wave" come to the Utah State House.


== Electoral System ==
The 75 members of the House of Representatives were elected from single-member districts by first-past-the-post voting to two-year terms. Contested nominations of the Democratic and Republican parties for each district were determined by an open primary election. Minor-party and independent candidates were nominated by petition. Write-in candidates had to file a request with the secretary of state's office for votes for them to be counted.


== Results ==
Of the seventy-five seats, Republican candidates won fifty-nine and Democratic candidates won sixteen.
