David William "Dai" Lawrence (18 January 1947 – 21 July 2009) was a Welsh footballer who spent four seasons as a professional at his hometown club Swansea City in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
Lawrence joined Swansea in May 1967 from non-league Merthyr Tydfil, and was the team's right-back when Swansea were promoted from Division Four in 1969–70.
In 1971, Lawrence was released by Swansea, and he subsequently returned to the non-league game, playing one season for Chelmsford City before an injury forced him to retire from the game. He then moved back to Swansea, where he worked as a carpenter. He died of a suspected heart attack in July 2009, aged 62.
