The Apostolic Delegation to the Pacific Ocean is an ecclesiastical office of the Catholic Church. It represents the interests of the Holy See in a defined region in countries with which diplomatic relations have not yet been established. It is led by a Delegate who holds a number of other titles within the diplomatic service of the Holy See, including that of Apostolic Nuncio to New Zealand. He resides in Wellington, New Zealand.
The Holy See changed the name of the delegation responsibility for Australia and much of the Pacific several times. On 1 November 1968, the Delegation to Australia, New Zealand, and Oceania was divided into the Delegation to Australia and Papua New Guinea and the Delegation to New Zealand and Pacific Islands. When the Holy See and New Zealand established diplomatic ties, Pope Paul VI established the Nunciature to New Zealand on 20 June 1973. The next year, when Archbishop Angelo Acerbi was named to lead the delegation, his title was given inconsistently as Apostolic Delegate to the Pacific Ocean (Delegato Apostolico del l'Oceano Pacifico) and Apostolic Delegate to the Islands of the Pacific Ocean (Delegatum Apostolicum Pacifici Oceani Insularum).Since then the Holy See has established nunciatures in several countries in the region, reducing the responsibilities of the Delegation to the Pacific Ocean. The new nunciatures include: Fiji, Nauru, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Vanuatu, Kiribati, Palau, and the Cook Islands. The Delegation continues to represent the Holy See in American Samoa, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Niue, Norfolk Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Pitcairn Island, Tokelau, Tuvalu, U.S. Minor Islands, and Wallis and Futuna.
