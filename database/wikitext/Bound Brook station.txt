Bound Brook is a New Jersey Transit railroad station on the Raritan Valley Line, in Bound Brook, New Jersey.  The station building on the north side of the tracks is now a restaurant; the other station building on the south side is now privately owned.  A pedestrian tunnel connects the south and north sides of the tracks.
The Norfolk Southern Railway's Lehigh Line, the railroad's main freight line into the New York City area – built and formerly owned by the Lehigh Valley Railroad until merged into Conrail – is a few yards south of the south platform and is used by around 25 freight trains a day. The Lehigh Valley Railroad used a separate station to the south.
