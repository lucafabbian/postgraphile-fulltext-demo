Vijay is a professional photographer from a middle-class background, who falls in love with a rich girl, Priya, whose father is Rajasekhar, a class-conscious man. They are stubborn in their love and marry against her parents' wishes. But soon the marriage is on the rocks due to the difference in their backgrounds, with the wily Rajasekhar playing his cards very well to split his daughter from Vijay. They have a fight and Priya goes back to her parents' house and Rajasekhar coerces her to file for divorce from Vijay.  After a few days, Priya visits the doctor for a stomach-ache and learns that she is pregnant. An elated Priya is ready to mend fences with Vijay and wants to tell him the news, but is blocked by her dad who has fixed her remarriage with someone else. She gives her dad the slip and goes to Vijay's house, just to find out that he vacated the place recently.

== Production ==
Naan Adimai Illai is a remake of the Hindi film Pyar Jhukta Nahin (1985). Rajinikanth wanted Sridevi in the film, and she accepted instantly. Director and producer Dwarakish, who also produced the Kannada version Nee Bareda Kadambari (1985), noted the difficulty in obtaining her dates because "her call sheet was similar to that of a superstar". It was her final appearance in a Tamil film before she concentrated on her Bollywood career, though she would later return in the 2010s. She had played the same role in the Telugu version Pachani Kapuram (1985).


== Soundtrack ==
Soundtrack was composed by Vijay Anand. The song "Oru Jeevan Thaan" is based on Misra Sivaranjani raga.


== Reception ==
Kalki criticised the film's second half, saying it looked like the film was stumbling without knowing how to take the story forward.
