== History ==
Construction began on 2 April 2001, and after four years of construction was completed on 30 September 2004. When the line first opened, some people complained about noise problems. Thus, sound-muffling walls were built along the tracks coming into the station.
Although the station platform only allows room for a three-car trainset, when the station was first opened a six-car trainset was used on the line. In this case, only the first three train cars' doors opened at this station (selective door operation). It was not until 22 July 2006 that a dedicated three-car trainset began service on the line.
