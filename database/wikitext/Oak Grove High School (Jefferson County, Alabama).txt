== 1998 tornado & campus reconstruction ==
An F5 tornado struck several communities of Jefferson County just before eight o'clock in the evening on April 8, 1998 with some of the most serious destruction in the Oak Grove community. The tornado resulted in more than 25 fatalities and destroyed numerous homes and businesses and destroyed the original Oak Grove High School on Lock 17 Road. The school, which at that point served grades K-12, was damaged beyond repair with the elementary school portion destroyed.
During the two years it took to construct the new school, students were relocated more than sixteen miles away to the campus of Gilmore-Bell Vocational School in Bessemer.  The elementary and middle school grades were relocated to the old McAdory Elementary School in McCalla, which was more than twenty miles away.  When the school was rebuilt, the County School Board made the decision to construct a separate campus for the elementary school grades. Oak Grove Elementary School is located across the road from the new high school on Tiger Cub Trail.
