On his return a war veteran finds his farmhouse burned to the ground. His young Native American wife and his little son have died in the flames. Responsible are a bunch of men who killed this man's family out of rage about his stance in the war. Using a false identity he goes to the close-by town where the murderers are to be found. He finds and confronts them one by one. Each time he uses his dead son's wind-up toy to remind them on their crime while he challenges them to a duel which none of them survives.
