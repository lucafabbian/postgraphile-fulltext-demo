Shaffer directed seven episodes in the Children of Jerusalem series, featuring profiles of Arab and Jewish youth, including the titles Children of Jerusalem: Gesho and Children of Jerusalem: Yehuda. She also directed Just a Wedding (1999), a docudrama sequel to I'll Find a Way.Her last film for the NFB, Mr Mergler's Gift, was short listed for an Academy Award in 2005. In June 2008, it was announced that she and colleague Paul Cowan would lose their positions as NFB staff filmmakers, due to budget cuts.Although the bulk of her work has been in the documentary genre, Shaffer has at times turned her talents to drama.
