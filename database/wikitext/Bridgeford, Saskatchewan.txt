Bridgeford is an unincorporated community in Saskatchewan at the intersection of Highway 19 and Highway 367. It is south of Lake Diefenbaker, the Qu'Appelle River Dam and Douglas Provincial Park.


== History ==
The community had a post office from 1909 to 1973. It was originally named West Bridgeford, after West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire, home town of early settlers. When the Canadian Pacific Railway built a station in the area, they shortened the name.
