La Revancha Del Príncipe Charro is the second studio album by Mexican rock band Panda, released on 11 February 2002 through Movic Records.
The band found moderate mainstream success, and was later certified platinum in Mexico with reportedly over 100,000 sales. Continuing with the lovelace, immature and humorous pop punk sound and lyrical content explored in their debut album, they implemented keyboard and synthesizer effects to their predominant skate punk tone.
