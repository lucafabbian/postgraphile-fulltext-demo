== Uses ==
Testing Anywhere is used to record, debug, schedule, and run test cases for a wide variety of application types, such as Java, Silverlight, .Net, mainframe, C++, etc.


== Automating Test Case Creation ==
Test cases are created using one of five methods (web recording, object recording, image recognition, Smart recording, editor). These test cases are recorded, saved, and can be edited and enhanced.
Test cases are edited with an editor. Wizards make it possible for people with no programming skills to create and edit these test cases.
Executable (EXE) files can be created so that testers can deploy (run) them on remote machines.
A workflow designer creates high-level business and IT processes and enables the ability to manage them.
