== Reception ==
In Manga: The Complete Guide, author Jason Thompson gave the series 1½ out of four stars and wrote: "The only mildly amusing premise is basically an excuse for Miura to draw macho sword fights and hordes of cavalry. Miura's crosshatched art is not at the level of Berserk or even Japan, and the fight scenes are disappointing".
