Then it was moved to Khaiarat which was situated by the river Feni. Then this area was known as Feni because of the river. It was established as a mahakuma with three thanas named Mirsarai, Chhagalnaiya and Amirgaon in 1875. Later, Mirsarai was included in Chittagong District. In 1976, a new mahakuma was established and the Khaiarat thana was moved to this new mahakuma and the mahakuma was named Feni. The first headquarter of the mahakuma was in Amirgaon thana. It was moved to Feni in 1881. During the administrative reconstruction in 1984, all the mahakumas were upgraded to districts and Feni became one of them.
