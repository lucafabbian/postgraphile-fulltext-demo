Initially the parish built a church hall in 1975 and used the proceeds from the rental of the hall to collect funds for the construction of the church. After the then Metropolitan Mstyslav blessed the site of where the church was built in 1978, the majority of the construction was guided by the active parish priest Anatolij Sytnyk (1933–2016).The church was consecrated October 17, 1982 by Archbishop Mark (Hundiak).The current pastor is Ihor Krekhovetsky.
