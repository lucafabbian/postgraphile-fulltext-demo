== Surnames ==
As a surname Hastings may sometimes be a patronymic surname from the Anglo-Norman personal name Hasting (also Hastain), but is usually a toponymic surname from Hastings in Sussex.Separately also a common surname in Connacht Ireland, where it is thought to often be a rough phonetic Anglicization of the Irish Gaelic sept of Ó hOistín who were followers of the MacDermots of Moylurg, first Anglicized as Hestin and Histon, then later Hastings.
John O'Hart in his work "The origin and stem of the Irish nation" published 1892, states the Irish Hastings origin is from the ancient Irish Gaelic name O'h-Uisgin, other possible Irish sources may derive from a Norse Gaelic personal name Oistín or a phonetic version of Ó hOissín another old Connacht Irish surname, a family name that can sound regionally similar when said in original Irish. This family are most prominent in County Mayo, County Limerick, County Kerry and County Clare.
