The Blue is a South Korean musical duo formed in 1992. The duo consists of Son Ji-chang and Kim Min-jong. They were playing leads in hit dramas at the time, and enjoyed explosive popularity among women when they debuted with ballads and dance music. They went their separate ways for a while after their first album, but reunited in 1995 for a second project and produced many chart-toppers.
