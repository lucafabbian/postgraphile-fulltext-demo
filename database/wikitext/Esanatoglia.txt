Esanatoglia is a town and comune in the Marche, Italy.


== History ==
According to the legend, Esus, the Celtic God of war, would be the origin of the name of the Esino river, on whose shores  a town, Aesa, is presumed to have been founded in Roman times.
The current name Esanatoglia was given in 1862, from a combination between Aesa and Anatolia, replacing  the medieval Santa Anatolia, which in turn was derived from Saint Anatolia, a 3rd-century Christian martyr. The first known document referring to Santa Anatolia dates from 1015, concerning the foundation of the monastery of Santâ€™Angelo by Conte Atto and his wife Berta. The monastery became soon the most important religious establishment in the area.
The city was ruled by the Malcavalca until 1211, when they were succeeded the Ottoni di Matelica. Three years later, and for three hundred years, the da Varano family hold the city. Under the da Varano Santa Anatolia maintained a certain autonomy: the first collection of statutory norms dates from 1324. The citadel remained immune from wars and pillages until 1443, when it was conquered by Francesco I Sforza. The monastery of Sant'Angelo and its  library did not escape the devastation.
In 1502 it became part of the Papal States.
