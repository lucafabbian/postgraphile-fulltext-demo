In enzymology, a 2,5-didehydrogluconate reductase (EC 1.1.1.274) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-dehydro-D-gluconate + NADP+ 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   2,5-didehydro-D-gluconate + NADPH + H+Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-dehydro-D-gluconate and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 2,5-didehydro-D-gluconate, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-D-gluconate:NADP+ 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 2,5-diketo-D-gluconate reductase, and YqhE reductase.


== Structural studies ==
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code 1VP5.
