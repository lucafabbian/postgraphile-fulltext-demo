== History ==
Beginning in 1975, the Vikes enjoyed a run of dominance that lasted until 1987. Enjoying 10 Canada West titles, along with five national titles, the 1990s would see a return to prominence. Highlighted by seven conference titles, including six consecutive, spanning from 1994 to 2000, the decade also saw three more national title performances.
Arriving at the University of Victoria in 1979, Tracie McAra would be part of a five-year run that saw the Vikes win 102 games, while losing only 14. Winning the Bronze Baby in three consecutive years (1980–82), the achievement complemented by four consecutive Canada West conference titles (1979–82).
Between 1985 and 1987, the Vikes would appear in three straight Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union (now U Sports) gold medal games, winning in 1985 and 1987. During that stretch, Lori Clarke emerged as a Canada West conference All-Star and CIAU All-Canadian in every season. Winning the Nan Copp Player of the Year Award in 1987, it marked the crowning touch to her athletic sojourn at the University of Victoria.
The 1986-87 season would also mark a finale for Janet Fowler. In her final season, she averaged 17.5 points and 8.1 rebounds per game. Earning the Most Valuable Player Award of the Canadian Interuniversity Sport (now U Sports) Championship Tournament, the Vikes were 28-2 in conference play during the season.
Having played with the Vikes from 1981–85, hoisting the Bronze Baby twice, Sandy Espeseth returned for her final year in 1987-88. Leading the Vikes to a record of 18 wins, compared to 2 losses, Espeseth earned CIS First Team All-Canadian honors, averaging 12.4 points per game and a career-high 3.5 rebounds per game. Espeseth would later compete for Canada as a member of the National Cycling Team at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.
The Vikes captured their last Bronze Baby trophy in 2003. The first time that the program hosted the National Championships was in 1993, finishing as the runner-up versus the University of Winnipeg.
After eight seasons, head coach Dani Sinclair stepped down as head coach of the Vikes in March 2020. In her last season, the Vikes were 12-8. Throughout her career, the Vikes amassed 105 wins, compared only to 59 losses.In May 2021, the Vikes hired former UBC Thunderbirds women's basketball player and coach Carrie Watts to be their new head coach. Having played for Debbie Huband at UBC, Watts captured the Bronze Baby trophy in 2004. Among her coaching achievements, Watts was an assistant coach for Team Canada at the 2019 Winter Universiade.
