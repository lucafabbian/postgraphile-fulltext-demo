He starred in a dual role in Carolina alongside Jonathan Stewart, until Williams' release in the 2014 offseason.  He then played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from  2015 to 2016. After his football career, he was briefly a professional wrestler.


== Early years ==
Williams was considered the top running back in the state of Arkansas in 2001, having played for the Yellowjackets football team at Wynne High School in Wynne, Arkansas. He missed most of his sophomore season with a broken bone in his foot. As a junior, he gained 1,044 yards rushing and scored 14 touchdowns, leading him to be named to the Arkansas All-State team in 2000. As a senior, he rushed for a single-season record 2,204 yards and 34 touchdowns, averaging 10.4 yards per carry while leading his squad to the state 4A championship.

In three separate games, Williams scored 24 total points, which remains a school record to this day albeit tied with four other players. Williams was named to the 2004 Pro Football Weekly All-America Team. He earned the Tennessee Sports Writers Association Player of the Year Award.


=== 2005 season ===
Before the 2005 season, Williams was considered to be a Heisman Trophy candidate. He was named by the Touchdown Club of Columbus as a "Player to Watch" in 2005. Williams started his senior season being held to 85 rushing yards on 24 carries in a 10–6 loss to Ole Miss but followed that up with ten consecutive games with over 100 yards rushing.

=== Legacy ===
Williams finished his collegiate career with 6,026 rushing yards, more than double of second place Dave Casinelli, who had 2,636. Darrell Henderson was the closest challenger to Williams's rushing yards mark with 3,545 yards from 2016–18. In addition, he totaled 55 rushing touchdowns, 19 more than Casinelli and Henderson. Williams was the only player in school history to have ten 100-yard games in a single season, a feat he accomplished in three separate seasons. As a result, his 34 100-yard rushing games are more than double the next highest total of 16 by Henderson.  He holds the Division I National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) record for  100-yard rushing games (34) and All-purpose yards (7,573). He also ranks sixth on the all-time NCAA rushing list with 6,026 yards. Starting in 2012, Memphis named their "Most Valuable Player" award as the "DeAngelo Williams MVP Award", which is given out annually at their football banquets.


== Professional career ==


=== 2006 NFL Draft ===
In January, Williams attended the 2006 Senior Bowl in Mobile, Alabama, an annual event in which college seniors and professional prospects are evaluated by NFL personnel in preparation for the NFL Draft. His height was officially measured at 5'9, which led some scouts to question his potential as an undersized back in the NFL. However, scouting reports soon placed him among the most impressive performers during the practice week leading up to the Bowl, and Williams punctuated the week with a strong, if brief, showing in the game itself, rushing for 31 yards on three carries and catching two passes for 28 yards. For the NFL Combine, Williams trained at D1 Sports Training in Nashville, Tennessee.On March 24, at the Pro Day on the University of Memphis campus, Williams ostensibly improved his draft stock even further with an exceptional workout. He ran his 40-yard dash in 4.40 seconds with the wind and 4.48 seconds against the wind. He also impressed in the short shuttle, the three-cone drill, and the long shuttle. In addition, he recorded a 34½-inch vertical jump and a 10-foot-9 broad jump and caught the ball well in receiving drills.


=== Carolina Panthers ===
Though at one point he was considered a top ten pick, with some projecting him as high as #4 overall to the New York Jets, Williams saw his draft stock fall in weeks preceding the draft, as many teams filled their needs at the running back position via free agency. On April 29, 2006, he was selected by the Carolina Panthers in the first round with the 27th overall pick in the NFL Draft. He joined Reggie Bush, LenDale White, Laurence Maroney, and Joseph Addai, among others, in a promising draft class at running back. He became the highest drafted player out of the Memphis Tigers program since Bob Rush went 24th overall in 1977. In addition, he became the highest drafted running back from the Memphis Tigers. Williams adopted the jersey #34, which he wore in high school, and which was the same as his hero at the time, Ricky Williams.


==== 2006 season ====
Williams played in the first five games of the 2006 season and looked promising as an alternative to DeShaun Foster in the Carolina backfield, compiling an average of 5.3 yards per carry. In Week 2, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had 13 carries for 74 rushing yards and his first professional touchdown, a three-yard rush in the second quarter, in the 16–13 loss. He missed Weeks 6 through 8 with a sprained ankle. In Week 11 against the St. Louis Rams, Williams filled in for Foster, who had injured his elbow, and totaled 20 carries for 114 rushing yards in the 15–0 victory. In a Monday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Williams started for an injured Foster and managed 74 rushing yards on 17 carries and an impressive 101 receiving yards on seven catches with a receiving touchdown in the 27–24 loss. The 35-yard reception from quarterback Jake Delhomme was Williams's first receiving touchdown as a professional. He appeared in 13 games, of which he started two. Overall, he totaled 121 carries for 501 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go along with 33 receptions for 313 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.


==== 2007 season ====

In the 2007 season, Williams continued to back up DeShaun Foster. He had his first 100-yard game of the season in Week 6 against the Arizona Cardinals with 10 carries for 121 rushing yards.  In the fourth quarter, he clinched the 25–10 victory with a 75-yard run, the longest in team history, only to be tackled short of the goal line. On the next play, he ran the ball to the right corner of endzone for his first touchdown of the season. The next five weeks, he had 97 total rushing yards due to limited playing time. In the final week of the regular season, Williams rushed for 121 yards on 20 carries while scoring two touchdowns in the 31–23 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He finished the season with 144 carries for 717 rushing yards and led the team with four rushing touchdowns. He finished ninth in the NFL in yards per carry (5.0).


==== 2008 season ====
Williams established himself as the starting running back for the Panthers prior to the 2008 season. During the 2008 season, Williams shared carries with rookie first-round pick Jonathan Stewart, though Williams received a majority of the work. In Week 5, he had 20 carries for 123 rushing yards to go along with 25-yard receiving touchdown in the 34–0 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs.  Starting in Week 8, Williams recorded four consecutive games rushing for at least 100 yards and a rushing touchdown with the Panthers going 3–1 in that stretch. On November 30, Williams set a franchise record for rushing touchdowns in one game by scoring four times in a Week 13 game against the Green Bay Packers where the Panthers won 35–31. In Week 14, Williams was selected FedEx Ground Player-of-the-Week after a dominating performance in which he rushed for 186 yards on 19 carries and two touchdowns against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors for his effort against the Buccaneers. On December 21, in a game against the New York Giants for the number one playoff seed, Williams rushed 24 times for 108 yards and four rushing touchdowns in an overtime 34–28 loss. He closed out the regular season with 25 carries for 178 rushing yards in a 33–31 victory over the New Orleans Saints. Williams did not fumble the entire 2008 season.Despite having a great statistical season, he was unable to make the Pro Bowl over Clinton Portis, despite having more total yards, touchdowns, and yards per carry. This is mainly attributed to Portis outperforming Williams the first half of the season, as well as the large Redskins fanbase. However, Williams did make the All-Pro team. He started all 16 games and finished the season with 273 carries for 1,515 rushing yards and 18 rushing touchdowns, to go along with 22 catches for 121 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns. Williams credited much of his 2008 success to a discussion with Vinny Testaverde and improved pre-game preparation. After the season, Williams was voted Pro Football Weekly and the Professional Football Writers of America's Most Improved Player of the Year.The Panthers finished with a 12–4 record, won the NFC South, and earned a first-round bye with the #2-seed. Williams made his playoff debut against the Arizona Cardinals in the Divisional Round. He had 12 carries for 63 rushing yards in the 33–13 loss.


==== 2009 season ====
Williams started the 2009 season averaging 55 yards per game in the first four games. He found the endzone twice in that stretch. In Week 6, he had 30 carries for 152 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 28–21 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In Week 7, Williams recorded a 77-yard run against the Arizona Cardinals for the longest rushing play in franchise history, breaking his own mark set in 2007. Williams would hold this mark until Christian McCaffrey recorded an 84-yard run in 2019. In the game, Williams totaled 23 carries for 158 rushing yards in the 34–21 victory. He followed that up with 21 carries for 149 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 30–20 loss to the New Orleans Saints. Despite missing all of three games and most of two more due to injury, Williams managed to rush for 1,117 yards and seven rushing touchdowns on 216 carries, as well as receiving for 252 yards on 29 catches, earning himself a spot in the Pro Bowl. He and Jonathan Stewart became the first running back duo since the 1970 merger to rush for 1,110 yards apiece (with Stewart rushing for 1,133 yards), as well as becoming the first running back in franchise history to rush for 1,000 in consecutive seasons.During the 2010 Pro Bowl, Williams scored a touchdown on a seven-yard run, the first by a Panthers player in team history. He finished the game with two carries for six yards and a touchdown, as well as a 15-yard reception.


==== 2010 season ====

On October 24, 2010, Williams injured his right foot during the Panthers' home win against the San Francisco 49ers in Week 7. He did not play again before being placed on injured reserve on November 17, 2010, with what was announced to be a mid-foot sprain. Williams finished the year with 361 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown on 87 rushes to go along with 11 receptions for 61 receiving yards. On July 27, 2011, Williams signed a five-year, $43 million contract extension to stay with the Panthers.


==== 2011 season ====
In 2011, the Panthers drafted Cam Newton as their starting quarterback. This resulted in a three-way split for carries between Williams, Stewart, and Newton. Williams helped the trio finish third in the league in total rushing yards with 2,408.  The Panthers finished first in average yards per carry and first in total touchdowns with 26. Williams finished the season with 155 carries for 836 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns to go along with 16 receptions for 135 receiving yards.


==== 2012 season ====
In 2012, the Panthers signed former San Diego Chargers fullback Mike Tolbert. The signing meant that Williams's carries would be split further with Stewart, Newton, and Tolbert. In Week 17, against the New Orleans Saints, he rushed 21 times for a career-high 210 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 44–38 victory. Although he played every game of the season, he only started 10 of the games. He recorded 737 yards on 173 attempts. He scored five rushing touchdowns and two receiving touchdowns.


==== 2013 season ====
In Week 3 against the New York Giants, Williams had 23 carries for 120 rushing yards in the 38–0 victory.

The Panthers finished with a 12–4 record, won the NFC South, and earned a first-round bye with the #2-seed. In the Divisional Round against the San Francisco 49ers, he had five carries for 13 yards in the 23–10 loss.


==== 2014 season ====
Williams rushed for 72 yards on 12 attempts in the season-opening 20–14 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He missed the second and third games of the season against the Detroit Lions and the Pittsburgh Steelers respectively, because of a hamstring injury that he suffered during a practice in between the first two games of the season. In a Week 4 loss versus the Baltimore Ravens, Williams suffered a high ankle sprain and was taken out of the game. His cast was removed on October 6, 2014.  Coach Ron Rivera has said that Williams would be able to return for Week 9 against the New Orleans Saints. In a Week 13 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, Williams fractured his right middle finger. He was listed as day to day. He missed a Week 14 victory over the New Orleans Saints due to his hand injury. He was listed as doubtful for Week 15 against Tampa Bay. After missing the final two games of the season versus the Cleveland Browns and the Atlanta Falcons respectively, Williams returned for the Wild Card Round versus the Arizona Cardinals.

=== Pittsburgh Steelers ===


==== 2015 season ====
On March 13, 2015, Williams signed a two-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers. The contract was for two years and $4.0 million, with $1.13 million guaranteed, and a signing bonus of $1.13 million.
Williams made his first career start as a Steeler on September 10 in the NFL season opener against the New England Patriots. In his debut, he ran for 127 yards on 21 carries, his most in a game since 2012. In Week 2, against the San Francisco 49ers, Williams scored three touchdowns on 20 carries for 77 yards in the 43–18 victory. Despite his success in the first two weeks of the season, Williams was used as a backup once All-Pro starter Le'Veon Bell returned from his two-game suspension. In Bell's first game back, Williams received only one carry for two yards in a Week 3 12–6 victory over the St. Louis Rams. In Week 4, against the Baltimore Ravens, Williams had only two rushing attempts for five yards in the 23–20 loss. On October 28, Williams was fined $5,787 for wearing eye black that read "Find the Cure" in honor of breast cancer awareness. During a Week 8 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Williams rushed for 71 yards on nine carries and came in the game for Le'Veon Bell, who left with an injury. It was reported that Bell had sustained a torn MCL and would miss the rest of the season, effectively making Williams the starting running back.In his first start since Week 2, Williams had a season-high 27 carries for 170 yards and scored two touchdowns, while accounting for 55 receiving yards on two receptions in a Week 9 victory over the Oakland Raiders. On December 13, 2015, he had 23 rushes for 76 yards and two rushing touchdowns in a win over the Cincinnati Bengals.Already without Bell, in Week 17 on the road against the Cleveland Browns, Williams suffered an ankle injury and did not return. This injury kept him out of the Steelers' 18–16 Wild Card Round victory over Cincinnati and the following week against the eventual Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round. Williams finished the 2015 regular season with 200 carries for 907 rushing yards and tied with Devonta Freeman, Jeremy Hill, and Adrian Peterson for the league-lead with 11 rushing touchdowns. At the age of 32, he became the oldest player to at least hold a share of the NFL rushing touchdown single-season mark since Marcus Allen in 1993.


==== 2016 season ====
Williams was again called upon to serve as the Steelers lead running back after another Le'Veon Bell suspension, this time for the first three games of the season. After two weeks in the 2016 season, he was the league leader in rushing yards after rushing for 146 yards against the Washington Redskins in the season opener and 94 yards on a career-high 32 carries against the Cincinnati Bengals in the next game. For his Week 1 performance, he earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week. His production dipped later on the season and he finished with 343 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns. The Steelers made the playoffs and advanced to the AFC Championship. In the 36–17 loss to the New England Patriots, he had 14 carries for 34 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown to go along with seven receptions for 51 yards. In addition, he had a successful two-point conversion in what was his final professional game. On June 25, 2018, he announced on Facebook that he had retired from the NFL.
