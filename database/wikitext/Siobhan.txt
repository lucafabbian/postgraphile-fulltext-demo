Siobhán is a female given name of Irish origin. The most common anglicisations are Siobhan (identical to the Irish spelling but omitting the Síneadh fada acute accent over the 'a'), Shevaun and Shivaun. A now uncommon spelling variant is Siubhán.It is derived from the Anglo-Norman Jehane and Jehanne (Modern French Jeanne), which were introduced into Ireland by the Anglo-Normans in the Middle Ages. The name first appears in the surviving Irish annals in the early fourteenth century.The name is thus a cognate of the Welsh Siân and the English Joan, derived from the Latin Ioanna and Iohanna (modern English Joanna, Joanne), which are in turn from the Greek Iōanna (Ἰωάννα). This Greek name is a feminine form of the Greek Iōannēs (Ἰωάννης), which is in turn a shortened form of the Hebrew Johanan (יוֹחָנָן‎ Yôḥānān, a shortened form of יְהוֹחָנָן‎ Yəhôḥānān), meaning 'God is gracious', and origin of the masculine name John and its cognates.The popularity of the actress Siobhán McKenna (1923–1986) helped the resurgence of the name in the 20th century.The Scottish Gaelic form of the name is Siobhàn, (which is sometimes anglicised Judith).The male Irish forms of the name are Seán and Eóin.
