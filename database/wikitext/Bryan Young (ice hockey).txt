== Playing career ==
Born in Ennismore, Ontario, Young played in 186 games over four years with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League. He was not known for his offensive game, as he collected only 30 points over that span. Instead, he was regarded as a solid, stay-at-home defenceman.
Young opened the 2006–07 season playing for the Milwaukee Admirals of the American Hockey League, but due to the Oilers not having their own farm team, was soon sent down to the Stockton Thunder of the ECHL. When a space opened up with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, he was moved there.
Due to a rash of injuries, Young was called up to the Edmonton Oilers in March 2007.
To start the 2007–08 season, Young played for the Oilers new AHL affiliate, the Springfield Falcons.
A free agent at the conclusion of his entry-level contract in June, 2010, Young signed one-year-deal with High1 of Asia League Ice Hockey.
On January 21, 2014, Young became a naturalized citizen of South Korea.
