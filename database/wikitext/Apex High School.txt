== History ==
Apex High School was selected by WCPSS to receive a major renovation. During the evaluation and planning phases, it was determined that it would be more cost effective and provide better facilities for the students of the existing buildings were removed and a new facility constructed. Groundbreaking for the new Apex High School facility was held on June 2, 2017. The facility will be a large expansion of the square footage of the existing buildings and eliminated the need for "Pods" and "Trailers" used as expansion classrooms. The 1976 Apex High School building was vacated by staff on June 14, 2017. The administrative staff and student services were temporarily located at Apex Middle School until the Green Level facility was ready for occupancy. Once the "swing space" (the Green Level HS facility located at 7600 Roberts Rd in Cary) was ready for occupancy and all materials from the Laura Duncan Road facility were moved into the building, all staff was moved to the temporary facility, which was temporarily named as Apex High School until AHS moved back to Laura Duncan Road. The move back to Laura Duncan Road in Apex was planned for the summer of 2019 at which time all AHS staff moved back and the temporary facility opened as Green Level High School, a new Wake County Public High School.The North Carolina State Senate passed House Bill 55 so that Apex, North Carolina police would have jurisdiction at Green Level High so they could have Apex High students in their jurisdiction.In August 2019, classes were held at the renovated Apex location. On August 12, 2019 A. Elaine Hofmann began her term as principal.
