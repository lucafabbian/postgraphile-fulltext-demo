Rahman’s track ‘Urvasi Urvasi’  from the 1994 hit Tamil movie ‘Kadhalan’.


== Critical reception ==
Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song a positive review stating:

"I'll knock you down like you're Keri/ Forget your name like Rihanna," he insists over slick urban-light beats with a voice that will undoubtedly draw comparisons to Justin Timberlake. The obvious clichés are all present and correct ("Roll the dice, I've got your number/ Hit the jackpot underneath the cover"), but he gets away with it, if only for his homage halfway through to Tequila, Tequila Tequila... .
