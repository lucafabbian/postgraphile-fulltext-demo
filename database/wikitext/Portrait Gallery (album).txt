Portrait Gallery is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Harry Chapin, released in 1975.


== History ==
An early version of "Someone Keeps Calling My Name", done in a folk-rock vein reminiscent of The Byrds, appeared on the obscure 1966 album Chapin recorded with his brothers, Chapin Music!. The main guitar riff (and entire arrangement) in this version is strikingly similar to The Blue Things' equally obscure 1966 track "Doll House." Another version of the song was recorded for the 1972 album Sniper and Other Love Songs under the title of "City Sweet", but didn't make the final cut. It was later released in 2004 on the Heads & Tales / Sniper & Other Love Songs CD compilation.
The album artwork was designed and illustrated by Milton Glaser.
Record World said the single "Tangled Up Puppet "shows the lyricist at his incisive best."
