"Southern Freeez" produced by John Rocca was the first single released by British dance band Freeez from their debut album, also entitled Southern Freeez. The album was self-funded by member John Rocca and initially released on his Pink Rhythm record label before the group was signed to Beggars Banquet.


== Song information ==
Freeez gained far higher recognition and sales with this record than with the previous singles "Keep in Touch" (which reached number 49 in the UK sales charts)and its follow-up "Stay"/"Hot Footing It". "Southern Freeez" reached number one in the blues and soul chart and spent two weeks at number 8 of the UK Singles Chart during early 1981Guest Ingrid Mansfield Allman provided vocals. The titular Southern Freeez is attested to derive from a dance move, "The Freeze," used by clubbers in the "Royalty" club, Southgate in the early 1980s. A then-popular song, "The Groove" by Rodney Franklin, has moments where the band drops out for a bar, and a style of freezing movement at these points took hold.


=== Remix ===
In 1987, the song was remixed and re-released by the label Total Control. The remix reached number No. 63 in the UK Singles Chart.


== Cover versions ==
UK soul singer Beverley Knight covered "Southern Freeez" for her 2011 album Soul UK. A cover also appeared on the album Brasil Bam Bam Bam (2014) by Sonzeira, a band formed by Gilles Peterson with Emanuelle Araujo and Valerie Etienne on vocals.
