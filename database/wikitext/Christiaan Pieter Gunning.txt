Christiaan Pieter Gunning (Utrecht, 12 October 1886 - Amsterdam, 16 June 1960) was a Dutch pedagogue and  classicist. He obtained his doctorate at the University of Amsterdam as a doctor in classical literature in 1915.
C.P. Gunning was a member of the family Gunning and a son of Johannes Hermanus Gunning Wzn. (1859-1951) and Cecilia van Eeghen (1858-1899). He married in 1911 with Sara Elisabeth Lulofs (1884).
He was the founder and first principle of the Amsterdams Lyceum (1917-1952), which as school was for a long time referred to as "Gunning". When in  September/October 1941 the Jewish students were sent away from the non-Jewish schools by the German occupiers, he organized a demonstrative farewell meeting with the motto "Vaart Wel" (safe travels). He got arrested for this and was sent to the concentration camp near Amersfoort.
Gunning also chaired the Reformed Council for Church and Family and the World Federalist Movement Netherlands.
