== History ==
 The college traces its origins to the merger of several institutions which became public ones in 1967, when the Quebec system of CEGEPs was created.


== Programs ==
The Collège Bois-de-Boulogne offers two types of programs: pre-university and technical. The pre-university programs, which take two years to complete, cover the subject matters which roughly correspond to the additional year of high school given elsewhere in Canada in preparation for a chosen field in university. The technical programs, which take three-years to complete, applies to students who wish to pursue a skill trade. In addition Continuing education and services to business are provided.
The Collège Bois-de-Boulogne is considered one of the best public CEGEPs in the province of Quebec and one of the very few public CEGEPs that are considered comparable to Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf and Marianopolis College. The bases of this claim are that 50% of the school's students come from private secondary schools; that 85% of the school's graduating students get accepted in the program of their choice; and that Bois-de-Boulogne has one of the highest percentage of students to get accepted in top programs such as medicine, law, architecture, pharmacy, engineering, etc.
