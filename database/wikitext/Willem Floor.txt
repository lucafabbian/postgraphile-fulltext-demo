== Professional Background ==
He started his professional career in 1968 at the Ministry of Development in the Netherlands. Between 1983 and 2002. Dr. Floor was employed by the World Bank as an energy specialist. For example, his report on a study of the difficulties involved in applying solar energy in developing countries, den Haag was published in terms of a book "Solar Energy." He was among those who 30 years ago drew attention to the problem of CO2 emission in his study, co-authored with Robert-Jan van der Plas, The Residential Sector and CO2 Emissions. Industry and Energy Department Paper Series, The World Bank, 1992.
More than anything, Dr. Floor is an Iranologist and is widely known for his numerous books on the country's history and literature. When asked about Iran and Iranians, he mentions, "I don’t think of people, any people, in having best and worst characteristics. Having worked in more than 50 countries all over the world during my 35-year career, I have found that people, wherever they are, are not that much different. What they have in common that they all react to the incentives that they are exposed to, political, economic, religious, etc. For example, if I say that Iranians don’t plan very well, but are masters at improvisation, is that a best or worst characteristic? It all depends on the circumstances and I don’t think it is helpful to contribute to the proliferation of stereotypes of people. Just take them as they are and work with that and you will be surprised to learn that what is considered ‘best and worst’ was based on lack of understanding and empathy."

When asked about his most favorite book in a 2017 interview during a visit to Iran, he mentions, "I have no idea what my best book is and have never given this a thought. In fact, I like all my books for the simple reason that I usually write about a subject that I don’t know much or anything about. My books are first and foremost written for myself, because they are the result of my attempt to find out what I can learn about a subject that may just be a term to me. I have written books that initially I intended to be an article, because when I begin my research and start writing I have no pre-set ideas where I want to end up. In short, having researched a subject and learnt more than I knew about it is the best thing."Some of his books are as follows.
