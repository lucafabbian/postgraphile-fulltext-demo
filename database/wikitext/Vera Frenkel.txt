== Work ==
In 1974, Frenkel worked with the Bell Canada Teleconferencing Studios to produce the work String Games: Improvisations for Inter-City Video, the first artwork in Canada to use telecommunications technologies. This was an early work of Internet art.
One of Frenkel's major works, ...from the Transit Bar (1992), is a multi-media installation with a functioning bar and video monitors playing individuals testimonials recounting themes such as exile, translation and cultural migration. It was a collaboration between the National Gallery of Canada and The Power Plant. It was initially exhibited in 1992 at documenta IX in Kassel, Germany, toured Europe in the 1990s and has been most recently re-exhibited at the National Gallery of Canada in the spring and summer of 2014.ONCE NEAR WATER: Notes from the Scaffolding Archive (2008) is a videotape about a city cut off from its lake and uses the scaffolding as a metaphor for both aspiration and loss. In the opening lines, its voice over narrative discusses the lake and sets the stage for the piece.  According to the artist's website, "This report is about a lake, and about longing. Also about greed, and about ways of bearing witness. I don't know the whole story, one never does."
