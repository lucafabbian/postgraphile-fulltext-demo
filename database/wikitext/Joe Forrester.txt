Vogel, later retitled Cop on the Beat (1975), and syndicated as a TV-movie.  In this pilot, Forrester, a second generation policeman, is a plainclothes officer in LAPD's Metro Division who convinces his superiors to put him back in uniform, and back on a foot beat, in a neighborhood beset by a series of armed robberies which are invariably followed by a vicious rape. When the case is solved, Forrester elects to stay in uniform, and on his foot beat, leading to the subsequent series.
