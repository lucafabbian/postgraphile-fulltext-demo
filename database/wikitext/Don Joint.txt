== Curator ==
As curator of the Shredder space, Joint was a pivotal to the partnership that formed New York's Schroeder Romero & Shredder gallery. Interviewed by Art in America Magazine, the gallery's director Mark Shortliffe encapsulated the program: "The gallery will always have a strong contemporary show but will hopefully stretch how we view new art by pairing it with older, influential works. We'll show two exhibitions simultaneously: one contemporary and one historical, encouraging a dialogue between the two."In The New York Times review of Schroeder Romero's VIVD and Shredder's PAVERS, Roberta Smith said, "The shows' invigorating call and response bodes well for future interactions between these side-by-side entities."As an independent curator, Joint also organized Manufactured Unreality: The Art of Collage at Francis M. Naumann Fine Art
