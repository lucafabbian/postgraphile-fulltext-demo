In April 2020 Woolhouse was criticised after it emerged he had travelled to a second home on the Island of Lismore hours before lockdown rules were announced. Despite public health advice for those not normally resident on islands to return home, Woolhouse angered residents and remained there for a number of months.On 19 September 2020, when the UK faced an introduction of "COVID marshals" and an increase in the number of reported cases of COVID-19 that some like Chris Whitty had termed a "second wave", Woolhouse instead favoured a Swedish-style model and "learn to live with COVID."
