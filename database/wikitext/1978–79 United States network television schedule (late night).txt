These are the late night schedules on all three networks for each calendar season beginning September 1978. All times are Eastern/Pacific.
PBS is not included, as member television stations have local flexibility over most of their schedules and broadcast times for network shows may vary, CBS and ABC are not included on the weekend schedules (as the networks do not offer late night programs of any kind on weekends).
Talk/Variety shows are highlighted in yellow, Local News & Programs are highlighted in white.
