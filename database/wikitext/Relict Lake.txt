Relict Lake is a small lake lying southeast of Pendulum Cove on Deception Island, in the South Shetland Islands. So named by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1957 because when Lieutenant E.N. Kendall made his survey of Deception Island in Januaryâ€“March 1829, Pendulum Cove extended inland to this lake, which has since been cut off from the sea.
