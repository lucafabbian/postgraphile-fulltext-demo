== Products ==


=== LiV Vodka ===

LiV is crafted using 100% sustainably and locally farmed marcy russet potatoes from Long Island, resulting in a gluten-free spirit. LiV is created using small batch pot and column distillation, bottling only the heart of the distillate.


=== Sorbetta ===
Sorbettas are the first potato-based liqueurs to be available in the United States. They are made micro-batches from the spirits of the company's vodka, combined with hand-peeled citrus fruit and locally-grown berries. Long Island Spirits offers five different flavored Sorbetta's; lemon, lime, orange, strawberry, and raspberry.


=== Pine Barrens Whisky ===
Pine Barrens is an American single malt whiskey crafted from a Barley Wine Styled Ale, and is the first to be distilled on Long Island. It is pot-distilled in small batches, then aged in charred American Oak casks.


=== Rough Rider Bourbon ===
Rough Rider is handcrafted by Long Island Spirits in a proprietary manner incorporating hand selected barrels of aged straight bourbon whisky, using local Long Island wine casks and a unique 180 proof brandy "cask finishing wash". The bourbon starts out as a highly refined mash bill, consisting of 60% corn, 35% rye, and 5% malted barley, and is aged for several years in charred new American white oak barrels.
