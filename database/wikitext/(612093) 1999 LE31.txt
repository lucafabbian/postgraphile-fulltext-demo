(612093) 1999 LE31, prov. designation: 1999 LE31, is a centaur and damocloid on a retrograde and  eccentric orbit from the outer region of the Solar System. It was first observed on 12 June 1999, by astronomers with the LINEAR program at the Lincoln Lab's ETS near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States. The unusual object measures approximately 17 kilometers (11 miles) in diameter.


== Description ==
1999 LE31 orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.3–11.9 AU once every 23 years and 2 months (8,462 days; semi-major axis of 8.13 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.47 and an inclination of 152° with respect to the ecliptic.It spends most of its orbit located in the outer Solar System between Jupiter and Uranus, and like all centaurs, has an unstable orbit caused by the gravitational influence of the giant planets. Due to this, it must have originated from elsewhere, most likely outside Neptune. It is both a Jupiter and Saturn-crossing minor planet. Of over half a million known minor planets, 1999 LE31 is one of about 60 that has a retrograde orbit.1999 LE31 is approximately 16.8 km in diameter. It came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in December 1998. It was last observed in 2000, and will next come to perihelion in February 2022.
