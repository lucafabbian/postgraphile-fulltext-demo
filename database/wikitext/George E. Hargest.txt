George E. Hargest (August 26, 1906 â€“ February 5, 1983) of Florida, was a philatelist who specialized in the study of the overseas use of United States mails.


== Personal life ==
Hargest was born in Brooklyn, NY to Archibald T. and Jessie E. Hargest.  He started collecting stamps when he was twelve years old.  His interest waned when he was in college and graduate school so he sold his collection to help defray the cost.  He received his bachelor's degree from Temple University where he was a member of Sigma Pi fraternity.  He started collecting again in 1939 but didn't become interested in transatlantic mail until 1955.  He worked as an associate professor of Accounting at Clark University in Worcester, MA.  Dr. Hargest was married to his wife, Lois, and had one son named Jay.  In his later years he moved to Florida for health reasons.
