The 2013-14 season saw Glasgow Warriors compete in the competitions: the RaboDirect Pro12 and the European Champions Cup, the Heineken Cup.


== Season Overview ==
Glasgow Warriors hoped that this year they would improve on last season's defeat in the semi-final play-off when they finished 3rd in the Pro12 league.
Al Kellock was named as captain again for the eighth season in a row.A row over the future of the Heineken Cup overshadowed the start of the season. In fact, this was to be the last year of the Heineken Cup in its present format and it was replaced by the European Rugby Champions Cup.

=== Pro12 ===
Glasgow Warriors had a great start to the season winning their first five matches leaving them top of the league. However the results over the winter period were inconsistent and it wasn't until the spring that the side really got going again. Matches postponed over the winter period against Edinburgh and Treviso really helped give a late charge to the line. Glasgow's victory over Edinburgh in the 1872 decider won the 1872 Cup for the fifth year in a row and they found themselves second in the league. By the end of the league season, the Warriors had comfortably secured second spot. In fact, despite the inconsistent winter period the Glasgow side finished with more wins than first-placed Leinster, with only the Irish side's knack of securing bonus points giving them a slender lead.
This was the last season that a top finish secured a home semi-final and possible home final, so Leinster were favourites in the play-offs. They played 4th place Ulster in Dublin in their semi-final whilst Glasgow Warriors had a bruising match against 3rd place Munster at a packed Scotstoun. Perhaps crucially it was the Warriors first semi-final at home. It was the Glasgow side's 9th consecutive win in the season run-in.Both Leinster and Glasgow Warriors won through, so Leinster secured their home final as expected. 5000 of the Warrior Nation made their way to Dublin to a very tight RDS Arena only to see Leinster take charge of the match in the second half and run out 34-12 winners.

=== Europe ===
Despite initial confidence over a decent European run Glasgow Warriors had a mixed European campaign in 2013-14. The first match against Toulon seemed to sum up the Warriors' European experience over the season; good in parts but not consistent enough to win out.
Unfortunately for the Warriors, aside from the opening two games in October, the European matches fell in a winter period when they suffered most from inconsistencies. Losing both matches against Cardiff Blues - a side that finished 7th in the Pro12 that year - really put paid to any hopes and the last match at home to Toulon which could have otherwise ended in a group decider fizzled out with another Toulon victory. Only wins against the Exeter Chiefs gave any solace and the Warriors finished bottom of their group.
