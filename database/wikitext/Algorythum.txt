Algorythum is the fifth studio album by Mentallo & The Fixer, released on February 16, 1999 by Metropolis Records. It was the band's first release without founding member Dwayne Dassing and was commemorated to his sister Danielle Dassing.


== Reception ==
Steve Huey of AllMusic said "although the group's overall sound hasn't changed much without Dwayne, since Gary composed most of their best-known songs, there is a slightly more adventurous quality to the record, even if there are no radical rethinkings." Last Sigh Magazine called the album a "peaceful overall work of music with a touch of noise, a good deal of programming on the more gentle side of things and some experimental in terms of how the release congeals in continuity to bring about a new direction for Mentallo & The Fixer." Ink 19 commended the band's new direction despite losing a member.
