The station signed on the air on November 11, 1961 (1961-11-11).  The original call sign was WGSB. The call letters stood for Geneva, St. Charles, Batavia, or "Where Good Sounds Begin". The station was originally owned by the Fox Valley Broadcasting Corporation. Nelda Brickhouse, wife of WGN-TV sportscaster Jack Brickhouse, bought into the station 1966, purchasing controlling interest in 1970. For many years, the station was known as the "Voice of the Fox River Valley".The station primarily aired easy listening music, but in 1964 the station began carrying Dick Biondi's syndicated program from the Mutual Broadcasting System. The station also carried the Jim Ameche Show, along with community programming including high school sports and local call in program "Party Line". Bill Blough hosted an overnight country music program on the station from 1967 to 1970, and again in the late 1970s. The station otherwise aired a MOR format throughout the 1970s.

In 1980, the station was purchased by Howard Miller, a former disc jockey and talk show host on 560 WIND. In December 1980, Miller changed the station's call sign to WFXW, after being unable to obtain the call letters WFOX. In 1983, the station was sold to Gamel Broadcasting for $580,000. In 1988, Louis Pignatelli purchased a controlling interest in the station.WFXW aired a full service format, with local talk programs and a strong emphasis on local affairs, along with adult contemporary music.

The station's call sign was changed to WSPY in 2002, and the station returned to the air under special temporary authority (STA), running 125 watts, using a long wire antenna in Batavia, Illinois. The station aired an adult standards format, and was branded "Timeless Favorites", carrying Timeless network programming from Citadel Broadcasting until the network's shutdown in February 2010.
