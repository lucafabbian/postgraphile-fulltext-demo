The 1963 Norwegian Football Cup was the 58th season of the Norwegian annual knockout football tournament. Also that was the first all-Norwegian cup, as it was the first year clubs from Northern Norway were allowed to participate in the cup. Of the two northern Norwegian teams that participated this year, Bod√∏/Glimt made it all the way to the fourth round. 
The surprise team of the cup this year was Sagene, a team that made it to the quarter-final, despite playing in the third division (tier three).
Skeid won the cup, beating Fredrikstad 2-1 in the final.
