Born in Elmhurst, Queens, New York, United States, Eichler began his career in the mailroom as an apprentice to publicist Lee Solters in 1963, and worked his way up to account executive at Solters' firm Solters, O'Rourke and Sabinson. Following admission to the Association of Theatrical Press Agents and Managers union in 1969, he worked as publicist on productions of Hello, Dolly!, George M! and Hair. He also promoted several major off-Broadway hits including Paul Zindel's Pulitzer Prize-winning The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds, the Elaine May-Terrence McNally double-bill "Adaptation/Next" with James Coco, Harold Pinter's The Tea Party and The Basement, the long-running rock musical Your Own Thing, Andre Gregory's experimental adaptation of Alice in Wonderland, and Tom Stoppard's The Real Inspector Hound.
