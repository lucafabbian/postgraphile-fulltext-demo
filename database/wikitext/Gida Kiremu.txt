It is said to have been found in 1807 by a man named Ayane Goro. In February 2001, fighting between former drought victims from the Amhara region, who had been resettled in the East Wellega zone of the Oromia region, and Oromos in the Gida district resulted in the death of one Oromo policeman and several Amharas. Press reports indicated that there were hundreds of deaths throughout the year; however, the total number remained unknown at year's end.  Other reports stated  that 12,000 Amhara settlers had been forced to flee due to the violence and that 500 houses were burned and 3,000 head of cattle stolen.Despite these reports, Gida was selected two years later by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development as an area for voluntary resettlement for farmers from overpopulated areas. Along with Guto Wayu and Jimma Arjo, Gida became the home for a total of 8435 heads of households and 31,781 total family members in that year. Gida was selected again in 2004 and along with Amuru Jarte, Bila Seyo, Ibantu, Jimma Arjo, Limmu and Nunu Kumba became the new home of another 22,462 heads of households and 112,310 total family members.
