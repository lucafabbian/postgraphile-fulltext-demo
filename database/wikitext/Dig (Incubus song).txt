Singer Brandon Boyd said the song is "about love but love in a platonic sense or love that stems from the power of camaraderie." He added, "I was in a moment in my life where things were looking really dark and the people closest to me — the guys in the band — were like a safety net. They were, without trying to, reminding me of who I was in the midst of some of my personal struggles. ... sometimes really good friends can remind you that you are not your ego."

The band made an unusual choice in letting fans help create the music video for the song by holding a contest called "I Dig Incubus", with the winner possibly having their video used as the official version. The top five contestants were announced on February 1, 2007, with fans then getting the chance to vote on a "Fan-pick".
Carlos "Kaamuz" Oliveira won both the fan pick and band pick with his animation. The video of the winner being announced was available on the contest website. Ramon Boutviseth was the runner up, and therefore won the Grand Prize.
On March 27, 2007, Kaamuz's video became available on Yahoo! Music. The final video was edited with scenes of the band playing the song.
