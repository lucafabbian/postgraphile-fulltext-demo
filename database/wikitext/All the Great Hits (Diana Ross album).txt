All The Great Hits is a compilation album by American singer Diana Ross, released in October 1981 by Motown Records. It was the second Motown compilation set to capitalize on the success of 1980's diana produced by Chic. Her duet "Endless Love" with Lionel Richie was from the film of the same name, Endless Love and, just like 1980's "It's My Turn", had already been released as a single and on a soundtrack album.
The double-album detailing Ross' career at Motown was released in the weeks preceding her RCA debut Why Do Fools Fall in Love and became her third album that year to reach the top 40 in the U.S.
The album was certified Gold in the US and Platinum in the UK.
The European edition of the album (Motown STMA 8036) was a one-disc release with a different track list, replacing "Endless Love" and "The Supremes Medley" with "I'm Still Waiting", "All Of My Life" and "Surrender" as well as including edited versions of two of the four tracks from the diana album.
When re-released on compact disc by Motown/Universal Music in 2000 All The Great Hits had a third, alternate set of tracks.
