The website also suggests that “th[is] album represents an escape. [T]he world has opened [Quintal's] eyes to what this beautiful planet has to offer; landscapes. For [Quintal], that's exactly what he experiences when he listens to new music. With this compilation, he hopes to spread awareness of these hidden, but electric tracks and artists that ooze fabulousness. Every track [featured on] Landscapes is guaranteed to do nothing but take you to places you've never been before.”
