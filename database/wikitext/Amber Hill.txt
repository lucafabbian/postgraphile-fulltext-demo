Amber Hill is a village and civil parish in Lincolnshire, England, approximately 6 miles (10 km) west-north-west from Boston. The 2001 Census measured its population at 268, increasing to 294 at the 2011 census.


== History and governance ==
The name Amber Hill reputedly comes from the village standing on a seam of amber coloured gravel. 
Amber Hill was a plot of 30 acres allotted under the Holland Fen Enclosure Award to provide materials for repairing the roads of several parishes having rights of common on Holland Fen. It was formed a civil parish in 1880.The village is one of eighteen parishes which, together with Boston, form the Borough of Boston. The local government has been arranged in this way since the reorganization of 1 April 1974, which resulted from the Local Government Act 1972. This parish forms part of the Swineshead and Holland Fen electoral ward.
Hitherto, the parish formed part of Boston Rural District, in the Parts of Holland. Holland was one of the three divisions (formally known as parts) of the traditional county of Lincolnshire. Since the Local Government Act of 1888, Holland had been, in most respects, a county in itself.
