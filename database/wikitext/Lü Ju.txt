Lü Ju (died 12 November 256), courtesy name Shiyi, was a military general of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was the second son of Lü Fan, a general who served under Sun Quan, the founding emperor of Wu. In 252, following Sun Quan's death, Wu's rival state, Wei, sent an army to invade Wu, leading to the Battle of Dongxing. Lü Ju participated in the battle alongside the Wu regent Zhuge Ke and general Ding Feng, and defeated the enemy. In 256, he got into conflict with the Wu regent Sun Chen and committed suicide after being cornered by the latter's forces.
