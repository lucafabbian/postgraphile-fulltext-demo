== Inflatable sculpture ==
Her sculptures recreate microscopic creatures in large scale floating installations. Inspired by animal, plant, mineral and bacterial worlds, her works deals with themes such as natural growth and decay while evoking feelings of struggle and vulnerability. Powered by large air blowers, the works are changeable and fluid, when refilled they often inflate differently,  tilting and sagging in new ways. The sculptures are usually completely white, requiring the viewer to fill in colors with their imagination. In other situations they will be made with colored fabric or filled with colored lights. Sometimes the works can be entered or contain windows for viewing the inside of the sculpture.

She is a member of the Denver artist cooperative Pirate: Contemporary Art.  She was commissioned to create a large-scale installation in the Denver Zoo.  In 2013, Nicole was a participant in the Biennial of the Americas. She spent 2015 conducting artists residencies in Europe, returning in 2016 for a residency at the Children's Museum in Denver. Her work is popular with educational institutions, and is often created in collaboration with Children. In 2017 she worked with students at McMeen Elementary to create an inflatable science fiction utopia. Her work has an element of social practice, and she started her own artist's collective called BAAM, Build Art and Make (the world what you want), the group created an inflatable torch, modeled off the Statue of Liberty. The torch was used to activist marches following the election of President Trump. In 2017, she was named one of 100 Colorado Creatives by Westword Magazine.
