The 2014–15 season of the Bayernliga, the second highest association football league in Bavaria, was the seventh season of the league at tier five (V) of the German football league system and the 70th season overall since establishment of the league in 1945. The regular season started on 11 July 2014 and finished on 23 May 2015, followed by relegation play-off games. The league season was interrupted by a winter break, which lasted from late November 2014 to 28 February 2015.


== Modus ==
The northern division of the Bayernliga consists of 18 clubs while the southern division consists of 19. Clubs in each division will play each other in a home-and-away format with no league games played between clubs from different divisions during the regular season. The champions of each division were directly promoted to the Regionalliga, subject to fulfilling the licensing regulations of the later with no overall Bayernliga championship game being played between the two league winners. The runners-up of each league takes part in promotion round with the 16th and 15th placed clubs in the Regionalliga. The four clubs play for one more spot in the Regionalliga in 2015–16 unless the Regionalliga champion wins promotion to the 3. Liga, in which case two spots in the league may become available. Should the champions or runners-up not receive approval for a Regionalliga licence the direct promotion and play off spots will be passed down to the highest placed club with a licence approval.The bottom two teams in the southern division and the bottom team in the northern division are directly relegated while the 15th, 16th and 17th placed teams from both divisions as well as the 14th placed team with the lesser points take part in the relegation playoffs with the five Landesliga runners-up.Seven Bayernliga clubs applied for a Regionalliga licence for 2015–16, these being FC Pipinsried and TSV Rain am Lech from the southern division and Viktoria Aschaffenburg, FC Amberg, SpVgg SV Weiden, TSV Großbardorf and SpVgg Bayern Hof from the northern division, with all of them having their application approved.

=== To the Regionalliga ===
The 15th and 16th placed Regionalliga teams, SV Heimstetten and VfR Garching, play the runners-up of the northern and southern division. In the north this is FC Amberg while, in the south, FC Pipinsried qualified regardless of its place in the table as no other team applied for a Regionalliga licence. The winner of these games then play each other for one more spot in the Regionalliga. Should TSV 1860 Munich have suffered relegation from the 2. Bundesliga its reserve team would be forced to leave the Regionalliga. In this case 17th placed Regionalliga club SV Seligenporten would have entered the relegation play-offs and Heimstetten would retain their Regionalliga place.
