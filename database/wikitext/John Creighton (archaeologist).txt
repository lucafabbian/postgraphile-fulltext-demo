From 2010-16 Creighton served as the Director of the Society of Antiquaries.Creighton has undertaken fieldwork in France, Germany, Spain and Britain. He has co-edited a volume on cultural interactions in Germany.Creighton has written two key-works reinterpreting the Late Iron Age-Roman transition in south-east Britain. Coins and Power utilised coin imagery to argue that Late Iron Age kings were obsides or hostages, who had been resident in Rome. Coins and Power has been described as a "essential reading for anyone studying the Later Pre-Roman Iron Age or Early Roman period in northern Europe". Britannia utilised a broader range of archaeological evidence to examine the influence of Late Iron Age kings on Roman towns in Britain and the development of the province. The Silchester Mapping Project (2005-10) undertook geophysical survey and digitisation of previous investigations at Silchester.
