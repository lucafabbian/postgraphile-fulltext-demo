Kim Loraine Appleby (born 28 August 1961) is an English singer, songwriter, and actress. She participated in the duo Mel and Kim, with her sister Melanie Appleby, until her sister's death from pneumonia following treatment for cancer.


== Solo music career ==
Kim released her first solo album Kim Appleby, in November 1990. The album included songs co-written with Mel for what was intended to be the next "Mel and Kim" album, alongside other songs that Kim had composed following Mel's death. One of these songs, "Don't Worry", was selected as the first single, and reached number two in the British charts in November 1990, as well as being a hit in Europe. As a result, "Don't Worry" was nominated for an Ivor Novello Award for Best Contemporary Song in 1991.
A follow up single "G.L.A.D." was a UK No. 10 hit. Subsequent singles from her debut album were "Mama" (No. 19) and "If You Cared" (No. 44).
Kim's second album, Breakaway, only received a limited release. However, she released three further singles, "Light of the World" (No. 41, 1993), "Breakaway" (No. 56, 1993) and "Free Spirit" (No. 51, 1994), which saw her reunite with Stock and Aitken.


== British Academy of Songwriter, Composers and Authors ==
In 1994, Appleby decided that she wanted to take a break from being a recording artist to concentrate purely on song writing for other acts. As a result, she spent some time in Sweden working with songwriter Anders Bagge, co-founder of the Murlyn Music Group. She has also collaborated with Michael Garvin ("Never Give Up on A Good Thing") as well as Sheppard Solomon (Britney Spears, Kelly Clarkson, Natalie Imbruglia).She also worked closely with the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA) where she chaired the Ivor Novello Awards judges panel for Best Contemporary Song for over ten years, and previously the Best Song Musically and Lyrically for two years.
