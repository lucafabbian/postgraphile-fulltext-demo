== Connections with other agencies ==
HPT connects with the Luzerne County Transportation Authority at the Wyoming Valley Mall  and Mohegan Sun Casino; Schuylkill Transportation System at McAdoo; and Fullington Trailways in Hazleton at the Church Street Station.


== Proposed merger with Luzerne County Transportation Authority ==
PennDOT has proposed merging HPT operations with the Luzerne County Transportation Authority, creating a unified agency for Luzerne County.  PennDOT makes recommendations that the merger would result in significant savings to both agencies with the merger, due to ending redundancies with upper management positions, an allegation that members of the Hazleton City Council dispute.  PennDOT also assures that passengers would see no changes to services, possibly improvements with better coordination with one team creating schedules.
