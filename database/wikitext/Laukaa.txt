== History ==
The name of Laukaa likely comes from the now obsolete word lauas (genitive: laukaan), stream pool, in this case referring to the Koivulahti bay in the lake Saraavesi. The name is also related to that of the river Luga in Russia (Votic: Laugaz), albeit only through the word from which the names are derived.
The area of Laukaa was an important route to both the lake Keitele in the northwest and Rautalampi in the northeast. Laukaa itself was a part of the Rautalampi parish, gaining its first subordinate church in 1593. This church was located near modern Tarvaala (aka Laukkavirta), which was therefore the original center of Laukaa. The center shifted to the modern location in Pellosniemi sometime in the 17th century. 
Laukaa became a separate parish in 1628. It included Saarijärvi until 1639, Jyväskylä until 1837, Jyväskylän mlk (to which Toivakka was moved in 1871) and Sumiainen until 1868 and Äänekosken mlk until 1907 (administratively 1911).
