glbinding is a generated, cross-platform C++ binding for OpenGL which is solely based on the new XML-based OpenGL API specification (gl.xml). It is a fully fledged OpenGL API binding, compatible with current code based on other C bindings, e.g., GLEW. The binding is generated using Python scripts and templates, that can be easily adapted to fit custom needs. It leverages modern C++11 features like scoped enums, lambdas, and variadic templates, instead of relying on macros (all OpenGL symbols are real functions and variables). It provides type-safe parameters, per feature API header, lazy function resolution, multi-context and multi-thread support, global function callbacks, meta information about the generated OpenGL binding and the OpenGL runtime, as well as multiple examples for quick-starting projects.
The complete glbinding source code including the generated files are published under the MIT License.
