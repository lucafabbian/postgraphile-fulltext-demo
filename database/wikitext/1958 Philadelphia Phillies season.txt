== Regular season ==
With the move of the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants to California prior to the 1958 season, the Phillies became the closest National League club to New York City, and in response, contracted to broadcast 78 games into the New York metropolitan television market to fill the void in National League games on TV in New York. Al Helfer and Rex Barney called the games for New York's WOR-TV. However, due to competition with games at Yankee Stadium, Phillies games were not able to match the audience for Yankee broadcasts, and thus, they stopped broadcasting games in the New York television market in the 1959 season.On July 22 with the team sporting a 39–44 record General Manager Roy Hamey fired Manager Mayo Smith rehiring Eddie Sawyer, who led the team to the 1950 World Series.
