Hits 94 Volume 1 was the first and only compilation in the Hits 94 series. In 1993, there were 4 volumes of the Hits series, however, the series was discontinued after this release. The album was released on LP, CD and Cassette by Telstar Records and BMG, and it charted at #2 in March 1994.
Like Hits 93 Volume 3, Hits 94 Volume 1 contains 22 tracks, a few of which are edited, some very crudely, in order to fit them all onto an 80-minute cd.
The Hits series then went on temporary hiatus until November 1994, when BMG and Telstar joined forces again for The Ultimate Hits Album.
Number ones included: Things Can Only Get Better, Two Tribes, Babe (Return Remix) and Without You.
