"The Key the Secret" is the debut single by British group Urban Cookie Collective, released in June 1993 from their debut album, High on a Happy Vibe (1994). It features vocals by British singer Diane Charlemagne. The song peaked at number one in the Netherlands and was a top 5 hit also in Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and the UK, where it reached number two. Its music video was directed by Lindy Heymann.
Today, the song is widely regarded as one of the biggest dance music anthems of the '90s and has been remixed several times. A remix of the song was also included in episode 2 of the second series of Channel 4's drama series Queer as Folk in 2000. "The Key, The Secret" was more recently covered by Phobos & Deimos. And German pop singer Jasmin Wagner, better known as Blümchen, heavily sampled the chorus and the beat of the song in the German version as "Er ist so süß" in 2000, which was released on her fourth studio album, Die Welt gehört Dir.

== Critical reception ==
British DJ Graham Gold named "The Key the Secret" one of his favourites in 1995, saying, "I don't care who dissed it – or if it crossed over into the charts. The vocal was so up and positive it made me feel how music should make you feel – good." In his weekly UK chart commentary, James Masterton viewed it as "a rather weak-kneed piece of girlie dance". Andy Beevers from Music Week rated it three out of five, describing it as a "poppy house tune with catchy female vocals". Upon the release of the 1996 remix, a reviewer of the magazine gave it four out of five, commenting, "A seemingly superfluous reissue remix of the 1993 number two hit. Nevertheless, the song maintains its effervescent hook of housey piano and celebratory vocal, and could well be a hit again." James Hamilton from the RM Dance Update declared it as a "Charlemagne cooed raving galloper". Mark Frith from Smash Hits complimented it as a "corking" single in his review of the High on a Happy Vibe album.Australian music channel Max included "The Key the Secret" in their list of "1000 Greatest Songs of All Time" in 2012.
