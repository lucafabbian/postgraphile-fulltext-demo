In 2007, Washington State Supreme Court Chief Justice Gerry Alexander presented the Judge William Nevins Award to Judge Mills at the Fall Judicial Conference held in Vancouver, Washington. The Nevins Award was created by the Washington Judges Foundation to honor those members of the judiciary who display extraordinary dedication to the judicial branch of government.
