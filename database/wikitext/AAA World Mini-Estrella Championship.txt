The AAA World Mini-Estrella Championship (Campeonato Mundial Mini AAA in Spanish) is a professional wrestling championship promoted by the Mexican Lucha Libre promotion Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide (AAA). The championship is exclusively competed for in the Mini-Estrellas, or Minis, division. A "Mini" is not necessarily a person with dwarfism like North American Midget wrestling, it can also be very short wrestlers who works in the Mini division. The Championship was created in 2008 after Mascarita Sagrada left AAA, taking the Mexican National Mini-Estrella Championship with him, leaving AAA without a title for their Mini-Estrellas division. Being a professional wrestling championship it is not won legitimately; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match.
