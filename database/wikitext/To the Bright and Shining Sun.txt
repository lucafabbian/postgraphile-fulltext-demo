== History ==
The song started out as an instrumental piece of music with the opening riff being the main feature. That piece of music was used in a major TV and radio ad campaign in Ireland. Radio stations started calling the band, asking them for the full version with vocals. As this did not exist at the time, the band set about writing and recording a finished version of the song to be released as a single. It went straight to number 11 on the Irish Singles Chart on the week of its release, spending a total of three weeks there. [1]
"To the Bright and Shining Sun"  later featured on the EA Sports soundtrack for the UEFA Euro 2004 official licensed game.
