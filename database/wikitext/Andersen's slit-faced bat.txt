== Taxonomy and etymology ==
It was described as a new species in 1912 by Danish mammalogist Knud Andersen. Andersen placed it in the now-defunct genus Petalia, with a binomial of Petalia aurita. Since at least 1939, however, it has been included in the genus Nycteris. Its species name "aurita" is from Latin "auritus", meaning "having long ears". Andersen wrote that it was similar in appearance to the hairy slit-faced bat with the exception of its "much longer" ears.
Still, it is often considered as a synonym or subspecies of the hairy slit-faced bat.
