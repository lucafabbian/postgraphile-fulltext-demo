The Nagano Electric Railway 2100 series (長野電鉄2100系) is a DC electric multiple unit (EMU) train type operated by the Nagano Electric Railway in Japan on Snow Monkey limited express services since 26 February 2011, replacing the remaining ageing 2000 series trains.The two 3-car sets were converted from former 253 series 3-car EMU sets Ne107 and Ne108, purchased from JR East in 2010 following their withdrawal from Narita Express services. They underwent modifications for wanman ("one man") driver only operation at Tokyu Car's Yokohama factory before being moved to the Nagano Electric Railway in December 2010 for final repainting.


== Formations ==
The two sets are formed as follows.
Car 2 is fitted with one lozenge-type pantograph.

The trains were initially finished in the same livery of white, red, grey, and black, which they carried in the JR days. From September 2012, set E2 was repainted into a new livery of red and white without the grey and black bands of the original livery.


== Interior ==

Cars 2 and 3 retain the original seating arrangement with fixed unidirectional non-reclining seating, 2+2 abreast, facing a centre pair of 4-seat bays. Car 1 has reclining/rotating seating, and also retains the original private compartment, seating four persons, branded as "Spa Saloon" (Spa猿～ん, Spa sarūn), a pun on the Japanese word for monkey. The original toilets are retained, but are locked out of use.
