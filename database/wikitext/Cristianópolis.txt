In 1905 Ricardo José do Vale, minister of the Igreja Cristã Evangélica,  arrived from Rio de Janeiro, preaching the Protestant faith.

In 1927 the name was changed to Cristianópolis.  In 1931 the village was raised to the status of district belonging to Santa Cruz de Goiás.  Later the district became part of Pires do Rio.  In 1944 the Franciscan order bought lands and built a Catholic chapel.  In 1953 Cristianópolis became a municipality.
