Decylcitrate synthase (EC 2.3.3.2) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction in enzymology.

lauroyl-CoA + H2O + oxaloacetate 
  
    
      
        ⇌
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons }
   (2S,3S)-2-hydroxytridecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate + CoAThe 3 substrates of this enzyme are lauroyl-CoA, H2O, and oxaloacetate, whereas its two products are (2S,3S)-2-hydroxytridecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate and CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is dodecanoyl-CoA:oxaloacetate C-dodecanoyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, 1-carboxyundecyl-forming). Other names in common use include 2-decylcitrate synthase, (2S,3S)-2-hydroxytridecane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate oxaloacetate-lyase, and (CoA-acylating).
