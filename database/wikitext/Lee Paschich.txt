Leland J. "Lee" Paschich (September 13, 1914 – October 5, 1993) and his wife, Helen, purchased the Chateau Montelena property from Yort Frank in 1968. In 1972 Paschich sold 90 percent of the property—retaining a 10-percent stake—to winemaker Jim Barrett and his partners, remaining on board as general manager.
