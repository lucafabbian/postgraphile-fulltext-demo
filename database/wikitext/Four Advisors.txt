The Four Advisors (Chinese: 四辅; pinyin: sì fǔ) is a traditional Chinese asterism found in the Purple Forbidden enclosure (Chinese: 紫微垣; pinyin: zǐ wēi yuán). It consists of four stars found in the modern constellations of Ursa Minor and Camelopardalis and represents the four assistants of ancient emperors. During the Qing dynasty, a star from the constellation Draco was added to the asterism.
