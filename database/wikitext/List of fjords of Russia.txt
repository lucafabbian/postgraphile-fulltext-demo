This is a list of the most important fjords of the Russian Federation.


== Fjords ==
In spite of the vastness of the Arctic coastlines of the Russian Federation there are relatively few fjords in Russia. Fjords are circumscribed to certain areas only; over thirty are in Novaya Zemlya â€”including lakes which are structurally fjords, with a few others in the Barents Sea coast of the Kola Peninsula, the Severnaya Zemlya  archipelago, the Bering Sea coast of the Chukchi Peninsula and the southeastern shores of Kamchatka.
