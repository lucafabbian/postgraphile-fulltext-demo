== Description ==
The document is a contract to lease one aroura of land near the village of Isionpanga. The owner of the land was Aurelius Themistocles, gymnasiarch and prytanis of Oxyrhynchus. The lessees were Aurelius Leonidas and Aurelius Dioscorus. The land was to be sown with flax and the crop to be equally divided between landlord and tenant. The dating in this document by the years of the Roman emperors is important, as it places the elevation of Licinius after 28 August 308. Some ancient historians had placed his elevation in 307, and this document provides evidence that 308 is in fact the correct year. The measurements of the fragment are 260 by 160 mm.It was discovered by Grenfell and Hunt in 1897 in Oxyrhynchus. The text was published by Grenfell and Hunt in 1898.
