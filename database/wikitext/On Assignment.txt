Original broadcast: 30 April 2014Rageh Omaar – Slavery ReparationsRecently fourteen Caribbean states came together to launch a united campaign for reparations from Britain, amongst other countries, for the part it played in the slave trade. The group's demands include compensation, an apology and an assurance that it will never happen again. Whilst trillions of pounds in profit from the trade went towards building countries such as Britain, the claim from those willing to sue was that the Caribbean was left poor, illiterate and suffering in extreme poor health. Rageh Omaar journeys to Jamaica to examine what lies behind those claims and he talks to those who are willing to go all the way to the international court in The Hague for justice.

John Ray – Hart IslandThere is an island in New York that many locals don't even know about. For more than a century, inmates from a nearby prison have been burying the homeless, stillborn babies and unclaimed bodies there. As many as a million lost souls are to be found on Hart Island. It has been described as secret, closed and restrictive. Until now, relatives have been confined to paying their respects at a gazebo at the edge of the shoreline. Diplomatic Correspondent John Ray joins one of eight women who has been campaigning for years to lay flowers at the site of her baby's grave and who now has the opportunity to do so, as Hart Island lifts its lid on its hidden past.

Geraint Vincent – Land and DemolitionsMoran hugs her children close as she gazes at the pile of rubble that used to be their home in the Middle East. Her husband Muhammad has his head bowed in humiliation. The soldiers came with their bulldozer during this morning and it took them one hour to destroy the house. Muhammad says his family have lived on this land in East Jerusalem for generations, and that the house was built by his grandfather. The Israeli authorities say the house did not have planning permission, and was therefore an "illegal structure". It is a familiar story in this part of the region, but there is something unique about Middle East Correspondent Geraint Vincent's report. Moran is an Israeli Jew who converted to Islam to marry her Arab husband. Now that their house has been demolished what does the future hold for the couple and their children? And as US Secretary of State John Kerry's timetable for peace talks comes to an end, how much has Israel's policy of construction and destruction done for what little faith in the process there was?
