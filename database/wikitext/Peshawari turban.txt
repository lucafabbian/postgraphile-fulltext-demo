It is a two-piece headgear. One piece is a dome-shaped hard cap or kulla, generally embroidered with golden thread.  The other is called lungi which consists of a long and narrow piece of cotton cloth (not to be confused with a waist cloth wrapped in some regions). It has a fan-shaped turra (crest) and a tail termed shamla.Subhas Chandra Bose had used a Peshawari turban to disguise himself as a Pashtun in 1941 to flee from the British territory.During the British rule a similar turban was part of the dress for some government peons.
