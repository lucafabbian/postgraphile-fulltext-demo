Talberg's oeuvre deals with antagonistic positions such as Nature & Alchemy, Asymmetry & Dynamics or Eros & Thanathos. From the beginning of 1990 he intensified his interest for Jewish mysticism and magic. On extensive journeys he collects new impressions that in turn shape the base for new manifolds. Talberg's life-time production is limited to 888 manifolds. His credo: "Finis Coronat Opus Magnum." According to art theory Talberg founded Neo-Fluxus, which is based on his manifesto 1995. The core ideas originate in Heraclitus “pantha rhei - everything flows” and TAO, the philosophy of flow, which also hold true for his Manifolds.
The Talberg Museum was founded in Offenbach am Main. Talberg's manifolds are represented in more than 200 public and private international collections as well as the auction trade. He participated in more than 100 international solo - and group exhibitions.
Talberg lives and works in Heidelberg, Southern France and Israel .
