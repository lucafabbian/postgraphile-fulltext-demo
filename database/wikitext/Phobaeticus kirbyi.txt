Phobaeticus kirbyi is a very long stick insect native to Borneo. The holotype deposited at the Natural History Museum in London measures 328 mm (12.9 in) excluding legs and 546 mm (21.5 in) including legs. This makes it the second-longest known insect in terms of body length, behind Phobaeticus chani with 357 mm (14.1 in). Both P. chani and Phobaeticus serratipes exceed it in total length with legs extended. However, recent specimens of P. kirbyi have only reached 283 mm (11.1 in) in body length.
