Paddock Wood Brewing Co. is a brewery in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.


== History ==
Paddock Wood was founded in 1995 as a mail order brewing supply business providing grain, yeast and other brewing supplies to the homebrewing market. In 2000, the business expanded to include brewing kits made in house to which customers would add yeast and complete the fermentation process at home.
In 2004, Paddock Wood Brewing Co entered into negotiations with the provincial regulatory body, the Saskatchewan Liquor and Gaming Authority, in an attempt to change a standing policy that restricted the licensing of microbreweries to premises where the beer was also consumed. In the same year the province changed the regulation allowing Paddock Wood Brewing Co to transition from a supplies business to a licensed microbrewery.
