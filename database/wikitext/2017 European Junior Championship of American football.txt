The 2017 European Junior Championship was the 13th European Junior Championship. It was held from July 14 to July 16, 2017 in Paris.


== Qualification ==
A total of eight teams reported to enter for qualification. Therefore, two four-nation tournaments were scheduled, with the winners of these tournaments earning a spot for the final tournament in Paris. Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland were grouped together while the other tournament was planned with Serbia, Italy, Russia and Hungary. As a consequence of the conflict of two organisations, both claiming to be the real IFAF, some weeks before the start of the qualification, a second European Junior Championship was announced to be held in Denmark. Russia and Hungary thus withdrew their participation in the Serbian qualification tournament.


=== Tournament in Serbia ===
Russia and Hungary withdrew. Italy qualified by a victory over host Serbia.


=== Tournament in the Netherlands ===
All matches were played in Almere. Germany won both games with a shutout and thus qualified for the final tournament in Paris.
