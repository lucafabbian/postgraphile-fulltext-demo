== Work ==
Barry's fields of academic specialism are contemporary poetry and literary theory. During the 1970s, he co-edited the poetry magazine Alembic (with Ken Edwards and Robert Gavin Hampson. Barry subsequently went on to set up his own magazine, Windows, which he co-edited from 1977 to 1981.His first book, which grew out of this editorial experience, was The New British Poetries: the scope of the possible (Manchester University Press, 1993, ISBN 0-7190-3485-X), which he co-edited with Robert Gavin Hampson. He subsequently published Contemporary British poetry and the city (Manchester University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-7190-5594-6). This literary critical study of contemporary poets writing about the city was followed by Poetry Wars: British poetry of the 1970s and the Battle of Earls Court (Salt, 2006, ISBN 1-844712-47-8), an archive-based account of events in the Poetry Society in the 1970s. Poetry Wars received a positive review from Matthew Francis in the leading poetry journal PN Review.Barry returned to poetry and the city in a series of essays. These include his contributions to Gladsongs and Gatherings: Poetry in its Social Context in Liverpool since the 1960s (ed. Stephen Wade, Liverpool University Press, 2001) and Writing Liverpool: Essays and Interviews (ed. Michael Murphy and Deryn Rees-Jones, Liverpool University Press, 2007), as well as 'London in Twentieth-Century Poetry' in The Cambridge Companion to London in English Literature (ed. Lawrence Manley, Cambridge University Press, 2011); 'Poetry and the City' in The Cambridge Companion to British Poetry, 1945-2010 (ed. Ed Larissy, Cambridge University Press, 2015); and 'Mapping the Geographies of Hurt in Barry MacSweeney and S. J. Litherland' in Poetry and Geography: Space and Place in Post-War Poetry (ed. David Cooper and Neal Alexander, Liverpool University Press, 2017).
At the same time, Barry was also publishing on literary theory. His first book in this field was Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory (Manchester University Press, 1995). This work has now gone through three editions and sold over 300,000 copies. According to Professor Steven Regan, Beginning Theory has had 'a vital role in shaping the way that theory is taught in Britain and North America'. In 2015, as part of Oxford University Press's celebration of University Press Week, Barry was asked to provide an account of the genesis and rationale of what was described as a 'ground-breaking and critically acclaimed undergraduate textbook'.This orientation towards pedagogy was further evidenced in his next three books, English in Practice: In Pursuit of English Studies (Bloomsbury, 2003),  Literature in Contexts (Manchester University Press, 2007 ISBN 978-0-7190-6455-5) and Reading Poetry (Manchester University Press, 2013), while he returned to literary theory with Extending Ecocriticism: Crisis Collaboration and Challenges in the Environmental Humanities (Manchester University Press, 2017, ISBN 978-1-78499-439-6), which he co-edited with William Wellstead.
Barry has also pursued these interests in literary theory, pedagogy and English studies through his editorials in English over twenty years and articles in journals like the THE and PN Review.
