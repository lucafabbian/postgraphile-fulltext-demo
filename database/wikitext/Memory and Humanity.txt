After writing more material than originally planned, the band decided to release a full-length album instead, expected out in September. Ryan also announced that the new album would contain harsh/screaming vocals, riffs and would be closer to Casually Dressed and Deep in Conversation than any of their other albums, although it would still be significantly different and more technical, saying that they want to move forward, and never back to any old style.The first single from the album, "Waterfront Dance Club", was released on 14 July 2008, in the 7" format as a double A-side along with the track "Beneath the Burning Tree", whilst the song "Waterfront Dance Club" was released as a free download on the same day.On 9 August 2008, the video for the second single from the album, "Kicking and Screaming", appeared on the band's MySpace page.The album was released on 13 October 2008 and reached #17 in the UK album charts selling 10,000 copies.
