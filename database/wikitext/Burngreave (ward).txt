=== Grimesthorpe ===

Grimesthorpe grid reference SK371901 is a suburb in north east Sheffield, lying west of Brightside and north east of Pitsmoor.
The settlement originated in the Dark Ages as a farmstead, passing from Grimshaw to Ulfae, the De Buslis, the De Lovetots and then the Dukes of Norfolk.  A guide of 1840 describes the appearance of the village as "exceedingly striking, and partakes in some degree of the grotesque", with it main feature being the Grimesthorpe Grinding Wheel Company.  The hills around the village had already been extensively quarried.Grimesthorpe lies below Wincobank hill, and in the nineteenth century was surrounded by woods, which were popular places for walking.  Between 1838 and January 1843 the area was served by Grimesthorpe Bridge railway station on the Sheffield and Rotherham Railway. The area became somewhat run down in the twentieth century.  A nineteenth century village pump survives in the suburb.


=== Osgathorpe ===
Osgathorpe is a small suburb of Sheffield, lying between Shirecliffe and Firvale.  It was probably founded by Norse settlers, and was for many years a hamlet largely owned by the Wake family, who were based in the now-demolished Osgathorpe Cottage.  The area was largely covered by housing in the nineteenth century.  Osgathorpe Park lies in the area.


=== Pitsmoor ===

Pitsmoor (grid reference SK362893) is a former village, now a suburb of Sheffield.


=== Shirecliffe ===
Shirecliffe (grid reference SK355905) is a suburb of Sheffield, lying west of Grimesthorpe.  Its name comes from "scir-cliffe", a bright, steep hillside.  In the mediaeval period, the area was owned by the De Mounteney family, who had a seat at Shirecliffe Hall, demolished in the early nineteenth century.  In 1676, the hall was home to a congregationalist church, founded by the curates of James Fisher, who had been ejected as Vicar of Sheffield.
