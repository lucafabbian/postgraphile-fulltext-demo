For the first time in history, more than 20 No. 1 songs top the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in a 52-week timespan. It will mark the start of a new trend in country music: a proliferation of No. 1 songs in a given year, a trend that – thanks to changes in radio programming Billboard data compilation – peaks in 1986 when there is a new No. 1 song every week.
Dolly Parton joins Porter Wagoner's band, television series and road show. She and Wagoner record their first duets, releasing "The Last Thing on My Mind" (their first major hit together) late in the year. Parton will go on to become the first woman in country music to have top 10 hits in five different decades.
The Browns disband when sisters Maxine and Bonnie leave the group. Jim Ed Brown begins the second phase of his long career – as a solo recording artist. The move pays off, as he immediately scores with "Pop a Top."
