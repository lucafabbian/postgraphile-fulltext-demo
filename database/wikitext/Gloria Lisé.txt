== Biography ==
Lisé was born in the Salta Province of northwestern Argentina in 1961. During her primary and secondary schooling, Lisé enrolled in the Music Conservatory of Salta, where she studied the piano and cello under some of Argentina's greatest musicians. She was also a professional singer in the Coro Estable of the Province of Tucumán.
Lisé was 15 years old when a coup d'état overthrew Isabel Perón's government and a military junta took control of Argentina on March 24, 1976. The political turmoil of this era inspired her to write her novels Viene Clareando and Paisaje de Final de Época, which focus on the impact of Argentina's Dirty War on its citizens.
The writer earned her law degree from the National University of Tucumán and her Master's Degree in Natural and Cultural Heritage Assessment from the Catholic University of Salta. In addition to writing two books, Lisé often contributes to Argentinian publications about artistic and cultural heritage.
Currently she works as a lawyer and professor at the National University of Salta.
