The film opened on 1 January 2016 to mixed reviews, with a critic from Times of India noting "much of the humour is silly and we do experience a twinge of embarrassment for having laughed at the uninspired jokes — but that happens only after the film is over". The critic also likened the film's plot to Massu Engira Masilamani (2015) and Om Shanthi Om (2015), stating that in "less than a year, we have had three Tamil films which have been inspired from the Korean comedy, Hello Ghost (2010)".
