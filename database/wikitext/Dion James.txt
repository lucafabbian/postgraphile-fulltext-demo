Dion James (born November 9, 1962) is a former Major League Baseball player who played as a left and center fielder for an eleven-year career from 1983 to 1985, 1987–1990, 1992–1993, 1995-1996. James starred at C. K. McClatchy High School in Sacramento, California, before being selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the first round (25th overall) in the 1980 Amateur Entry Draft.  He played for the Brewers, Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees all of the American League and the Atlanta Braves of the National League.
James was the Brewers' Rookie of the Year in 1984, when he won the center field job and batted .295. In 1987, James was traded to the Braves for Brad Komminsk. With the Braves, the slap-hitter switched from a straight-up stance to an open crouch, giving him new power; he hit .312 with 37 doubles and 10 homers in 1987.  James was a major disappointment in Atlanta's dismal 1988 season and was criticized for erratic fielding. He was traded to the Indians in mid-1989 for Oddibe McDowell, the Rangers' number-one pick in 1984.  James lasted less than two seasons with the Indians, but found a part-time job with the Yankees in 1992, hitting .332 as the club's everyday left fielder in 1993. James left for Japan after the season; when he returned to the club in '95, he found little playing time in the Yankees outfield (by that time well-stocked with burgeoning talent) but did see post-season action for the first time in his career.
