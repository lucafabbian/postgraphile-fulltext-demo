The 1986 Daytona 500, the 28th running of the event, was held February 16 at Daytona International Speedway, in Daytona Beach, Florida. it was the first race of 29 in the 1986 NASCAR Winston Cup season. Defending race winner Bill Elliott won the pole for the second year in a row, and outside pole sitter Geoffrey Bodine won the race and led 101 laps, including the final 34.


== Race Recap ==
On lap 116, a major accident (such crashes are now known as "The Big One") in turn 4 involved several cars, including some contenders for the win. 1980 winner Buddy Baker, Neil Bonnett (already several laps down after earlier problems), defending race winner Bill Elliott, Tommy Ellis, Harry Gant, Kyle Petty, Joe Ruttman, Lake Speed, & four-time 500 winner Cale Yarborough were involved in the crash, but Elliott, Ellis, Petty, and Speed were able to continue the race.
Geoff Bodine won this race on fuel mileage after engaging in a long feud with Dale Earnhardt.  Earnhardt was forced to pit for gas with three laps to go, then blew the engine leaving the pits.  This allowed Bodine to cruise to victory by a margin of over 11 seconds. It was the first of many hard luck finishes for Dale Earnhardt that would last until the 1998 race.
Prior to the race, the drivers paid tribute to the astronauts who were killed in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which was several miles away from the track 19 days earlier. They would do so again for the 2003 Daytona 500, which took place two weeks after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
