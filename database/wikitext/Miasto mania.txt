Miasto mania is the debut studio album by Polish singer Maria Peszek, released in 2005 by Kayax. Thematically, it was a homage to Poland's capital, Warsaw, and served as a musical background to a multi-media theatre play of the same title which premiered simultaneously. All songs were co-written by Peszek and composed by Wojciech Waglewski and Emade who also produced the album. Miasto mania spawned the popular lead single "Moje miasto" and was a critical and commercial success, eventually earning platinum certification for selling in over 40,000 copies in Poland.
