The 2014 United States Senate election in Oklahoma took place on November 4, 2014 to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the State of Oklahoma, concurrently with the special election to Oklahoma's other Senate seat, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states and elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections.
Incumbent Republican Senator Jim Inhofe was running for re-election to a fourth term in office. He won the Republican primary against several minor candidates; Democratic nominee Matt Silverstein, an insurance agency owner, was unopposed for his party's nomination. This was Inhofe's first election in which he won every county, and his only election in which he won majority in every county.
