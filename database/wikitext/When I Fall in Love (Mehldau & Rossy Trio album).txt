When I Fall in Love is an album by the Mehldau & Rossy Trio, consisting of pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Mario Rossy, and drummer Jorge Rossy.


== Music and recording ==
The album was recorded in concert at La Cova del Drac in Barcelona on October 9 and 10, 1993.On the up-tempo "Anthropology", Mehldau plays the melody "note for note and then begins to move through the lower register for sevenths and ninths, playing 16th and even 32nd notes to corral the rhythm section as he moves the scale over first a half, then a whole, and then two and a half steps."


== Reception ==
The AllMusic reviewer wrote that "This may not be as great as some of Meldau's later trio work, but it is very impressive for such an early date."
