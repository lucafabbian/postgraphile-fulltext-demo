== Release and reception ==
By the time of the album's release, newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo believed it would soon disappear from the stores, just like his previous 78 RPM releases.In 2007, it was listed by Rolling Stone Brazil as one of the 100 best Brazilian albums in history. American critic Rodney Taylor wrote of the album: "His first album, which translates to 'New Style Samba,' sets out his ambitions. Spritely, percussive guitar anchors the songs, and Ben's smooth/rough voice puts them across. Horns, percussion and strings color the tunes, but never pull the focus from Ben. 'Mas que Nada' ranks as one of the most popular songs in the world."
