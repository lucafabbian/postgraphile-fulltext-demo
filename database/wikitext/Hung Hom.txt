== History ==
Originally, Hung Hom was much smaller than the present-day context. Hung Hom Bay has been partially reclaimed several times since 1850, expanding the area of Hung Hom as a consequence. Rumsey Rock, formerly located in the bay, was buried in the reclamation process. Later a town was developed eastward parallel to the Hong Kong and Whampoa Dock.
Hung Hom was renamed to "Yamashita District" during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945. It was one of the few places to be renamed.
