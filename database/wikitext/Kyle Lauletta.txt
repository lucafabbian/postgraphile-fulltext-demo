== Early life ==
Lauletta attended the East campus of Downingtown High School in Downingtown, Pennsylvania, and was the starting quarterback for the Cougars football team for his last two years. He  came from a family of football players; his father Joe and uncle Lex played quarterback and punter for Navy, respectively, and two of his brothers have also been quarterbacks for Downingtown East. In his first start, he threw for 400 yards and ran for two touchdowns against the defending state champions. He also played lacrosse.  Despite his accolades in high school, an off-season injury and bad luck largely prevented any premium FBS schools from recruiting Lauletta, and he eventually chose to attend Richmond.


== College career ==
Lauletta played at Richmond from 2013 to 2017. He tore his ACL in 2016 on a quarterback scramble after leading Richmond to an 8–2 record at the time, but recovered and played all games in 2017, his best statistical season. During his collegiate career, he threw for a school-record 10,465 yards and 73 touchdowns. Lauletta was invited to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl, in which he threw for 198 yards and three touchdowns and was named the game's MVP.
