In an interview in 2017, he stated that as a lawyer he would have wished “the independent and fairly functioning Constitutional Court restored (...), the authentic independence of judges a fact (...). The executive authority seeks to ensure its influence over the judiciary by selection of judges. (...) Thirdly, I wish the independence of prosecutors. I agree with those who say that the prosecutor should be obliged to follow orders. However, he should not be afraid of the consequences of taking his own position. And at the moment he has reason to be afraid.”
