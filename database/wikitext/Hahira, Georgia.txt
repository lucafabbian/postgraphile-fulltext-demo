Hahira Middle SchoolThe South Georgia Regional Library operates the Walter R. & Dorothy Salter Hahira Library. For many years, the public library of Hahira consisted of a few thousand books in a small room in City Hall, operated by Jackie Matthews and open only on Thursday afternoons. Then the state of Georgia launched a massive grant program to its cities, promising funds that would pay 90 percent of construction and furnishings to local governments that matched funds and provided land. Hahira citizens were divided down the middle, torn between serious water and sewage issues and their own public library. But in the end, Hahira, which was known during the 1920s as the Queen Bee Capital of the World, received a honey of a library, which opened on March 12, 1989. The library acquired its name from Walter R. Salter, a former mayor, councilman, and local business owner who had long desired a library for the community. Upon his death in 1984, his wife Dorothy came forward with a gift of $30,000. Dorothy was present at the library's formal dedication and Clara Vinson was named as the first manager.
