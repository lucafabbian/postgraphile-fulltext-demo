Rosie Sings Bing is a 1978 studio album by the American jazz singer Rosemary Clooney, recorded in tribute to Bing Crosby, who had died the previous year. The album 
was the second Clooney made for Concord Records.
Clooney and Crosby recorded two albums of duets, Fancy Meeting You Here (1958) and That Travelin' Two-Beat (1965), and Clooney accompanied Crosby at his 1977 performances at the London Palladium shortly before Crosby died.
Clooney recorded her tribute to Crosby with a quintet of jazz musicians that included saxophonist Scott Hamilton, Cal Collins, Nat Pierce, Monty Budwig, and Jake Hanna. All but Collins had appeared on her previous Concord album. Drummer Jake Hanna had also performed with Bing live on stage in Norway on 27 August 1977.
The liner notes for this album were written by Bing's widow, Kathryn Crosby.
