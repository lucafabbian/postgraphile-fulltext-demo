Delovoy Tsentr (Russian: Деловой центр) is a station on the Moscow Central Circle of the Moscow Metro that opened in September 2016.


== Name ==
The station is named for the adjacent Moscow International Business Center, also known as Moscow City. The station was originally planned to be Citi, but was changed to Delovoy Tsentr prior to the opening of the line.


== Transfer ==
The station offers out-of-station transfers to the Filyovskaya Line at Mezhdunarodnaya; but there is no direct interchange corridor to the namesake station of the Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya Line and Bolshaya Koltsevaya line
