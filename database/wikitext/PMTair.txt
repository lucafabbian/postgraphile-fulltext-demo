== Accidents and incidents ==
On November 21, 2005, a Yunshuji Y7-100C operated by PMTair left the runway when landing at Ban Lung, Ratanakiri and sheared a leg off its landing gear. Fifty-nine passengers and six crew members were aboard. There were no injuries. The aircraft was XU-072, leased from Royal Phnom Penh Airways, and formerly operated by President Airlines. As a result of this accident, United Nations personnel were barred from using the airline.
On June 25, 2007, PMTair Flight U4 241, an Antonov An-24 with 16 passengers and six crew crashed in a mountainous jungle area of Kampot Province. The flight had departed Angkor International Airport and was heading for Sihanoukville International Airport, and disappeared from radar at around 10:40 a.m. local time (0340 UTC). Aboard were 13 South Koreans and three Czech passengers, and the crew of one Uzbekistani pilot and five Cambodians. Because of weather and rugged terrain, search-and-rescue crews took two days to find the crash site. No survivors were found.
