Aqua Teen Hunger Force (also known by various alternative titles) is an American adult animated television series that aired on Cartoon Network's late night programming block, Adult Swim. The show is about the surreal adventures and antics of three anthropomorphic fast food items: Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad, who live together as roommates in a neighborhood in the suburbs next door to a human named Carl Brutananadilewski.
An early version of the pilot episode originally aired months prior to the launch of Adult Swim on Cartoon Network unannounced on December 30, 2000. It later made its debut on Adult Swim on September 2, 2001, and ended on August 30, 2015, with a total of 139 episodes, over the course of eleven seasons. An episode titled "Boston" was scheduled to air during the fifth season, but was pulled to avoid further controversy surrounding the 2007 Boston Mooninite panic, and has never aired or formally released to the public legally in any format. In most seasons several episodes aired outside of their production order.
The series was created by Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro, who wrote and directed every episode, and provided the voices of several characters. The series was inspired by the Space Ghost Coast to Coast episode "Baffler Meal", which was not produced until after Aqua Teen Hunger Force premiered and did not air until 2003. Seasons 8–11 were each given a different alternative title, as a running gag from series creators, who wanted to try to change things in the series. Each alternatively titled season features different theme music from various composers.On April 13, 2007, a feature film based on the series, Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters, premiered in theaters, marking the first time an original Adult Swim series was adapted into a feature-length film. The series also airs in syndication outside the United States and has been released on various DVD sets and other forms of home media, including on-demand streaming.
