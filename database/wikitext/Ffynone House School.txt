== History ==
Ffynone House School is located on the site that was formerly St Winefride's Convent School for Girls, run by nuns from 1887 to 1969 and throughout the Second World War. Ffynone House School was opened in 1973 by Swansea businessman Marshall David, and became Ffynone House School Trust (FHST) following the latter's death.The School's early motto "Non Sibi Sed Omnibus" (Not for one's self, but for all) was updated to "Where Individuals Matter", which underpins the ethos of the school. The early school badge proclaiming "Endeavour-Achievement-Excellence" was updated to "Virtus" (Virtue) in 1995. The addition of a yellow Acorn to the badge reflected the purchase of Oakleigh House Primary School as part of the growing Ffynone House School Trust.In 2007, both primary and secondary school businesses were purchased by Cognita, a private education consortium. The capital assets and freeholds of both schools remained the property of FHST. In 2013, Cognita considered the viability of maintaining the school in its current form which was located on two separate sites.  The primary and secondary schools were subsequently separated; the Oakleigh House primary department remained inside the Cognita consortium, and Ffynone House School’s secondary department was transferred back to the ownership of the FHS Charitable Trust. The school remains open as an independent day school in the Uplands area of Swansea.

Pupils from the school regularly participate in science-based competitions and have enjoyed success in the South West Wales Chemical Olympiad Competition.
