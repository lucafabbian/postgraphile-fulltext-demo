Between 1984 and 1994, a second cabinet position was dedicated to higher education in addition to the position responsible for primary and secondary education. Premier Pauline Marois has restored this function with the nomination of Pierre Duchesne on September 19, 2012. Following the 2014 election, the function was re-merged with Education.
It was re-created in 2016 following Pierre Moreau's leave of absence for health reasons, in which his responsibilities were divided. Under François Legault's  Coalition Avenir Québec government elected in 2018, the position was briefly re-merged again, but reinstated in June 2020 as part of a shuffle.The following persons have served as Quebec's Minister of Higher Education, Science, and Technology.
