Cameron received a B.S. in biology from Yale College. She earned a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the Rockefeller University, where she worked with Bruce McEwen and Elizabeth Gould examining neurogenesis in the adult rat dentate gyrus. Her 1995 dissertation was titled, Regulation of adult neurogenesis in the rat dentate gyrus by adrenal steroids and excitatory input. Bruce McEwen was her doctoral advisor. In 1995, she came to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) during a postdoctoral fellowship with Ronald D.G. McKay at National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS). Her postdoctoral research determined the magnitude of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and investigated the effects of stress hormones on neurogenesis in the aging rat hippocampus.Cameron joined the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program at National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) as an investigator in 2001. By 2014, she was the chief of the section on neuroplasticity. Her laboratory studies the regulation of adult neurogenesis and the role of the newly born neurons in normal hippocampal function as well as in diseases involving the hippocampus. In 2014, Cameron was an associate editor of  The Journal of Neuroscience.Cameron has three children.
