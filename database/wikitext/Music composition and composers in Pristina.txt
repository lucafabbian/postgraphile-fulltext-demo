== History of composition genre development in Pristina ==


=== Folklore ===

Kosovan Music is considered to be very rich in genres and their development. But before talking about genre development, a key point that has to be mentioned is without doubt the rich Folklore of Kosovo most of which unfortunately has not been digitalized and/or saved in archives. The importance of folklore is reflected in two main keys, it is considered a "treasure" of cultural heritage of our country and it helps to enlighten the Albanian and Kosovan history of that time, and the importance of that is of a high level especially when mentioning the circumstances of our territory in that time. 
Folklor has also served as inspiration and influence in many fields including music composition in the next generations  
One of the most notable and very first composers: Rexho Mulliqi in whose work, folklore inspiration and influence is very present.


=== Professional (artistic) music ===
When highlighting the music creativity and its starts in Kosovo and the relation between it and the music creativity in Albania even though they have had their
development in different circumstances, it is proved that they share some characteristics in a very natural way. This fact shows that they belong to one "Cultural Tree".
Professional music (referred to as artistic music) in Kosovo dates back to the late 1940s.
An important historical even is the finding of the ancient instrument: "Okarina Autentike" (The authentic okarina).
More visible traces of Professional Music in Kosovo can be found in the post-war period when the first radio station in Prizren was opened in 1945 and it was later moved to Pristina.
This was followed by the opening of the Arts Academy, the first recordings, other recordings made for the specific programs of that time.
Another important move was made when the Orchestra of the same Radio was founded, a move which opened doors to the organization of further events and festivals which gradually became a tradition.
The production of Radio Pristina also served as a gathering of the only professional ensembles of that time which were:

The Folks Music Orchestra
The Pop Music Orchestra
The Symphony Orchestra (found in the 1950s)
The Professional Choir (found in 1980)
The Children's ChoirAnother thing of higher importance were the "three associations" which also served as gathering for musicians.
The Association of Composers which had 30 members; which were composers of different genres and a number of authors.
The Association of Musicians and Artists which had 20 members; including productive artists, instrumentalists, kapellmeisters, and singers.
The Association of Music Professors which had a wider range of members.The most important Association was the one of Composers which besides the gatherings of musicians and artists, organized a number of other music related activities.
This association was the founder of the festival "Ditet e Muzikes Kosovare" (The Days of Kosovan Music) which was organized from 1979 to 1992.
The Music Activities an interruption from 1990 to 1999 due to political circumstances. The activity of Kosovan composers had its development in and outside Kosovo.
Even though small in numbers of composers the creativity level was on a high level.
