== Reception ==
AllMusic awarded the album with 4 stars and its review by Scott Yanow states: "The music (which includes such numbers as "Tell You What", "Dirty Rice", "Wabash" and "Spy Vs. Spy") has few memorable melodies but plenty of dynamic playing by Scofield, who at this point was growing as a major stylist from album to album".
