== Vessels captured during the Russian annexation of Crimea (2014) ==
List of captured ships of the Ukrainian Navy (at least 100 vessels). On 8 April 2014, an agreement had been reached between Russia and Ukraine to return captured vessels to Ukraine and "for the withdrawal of an undisclosed number of Ukrainian aircraft seized in Crimea". At the time, Russian naval sources claimed that the Ukrainian ships were "not operational because they are old, obsolete, and in poor condition". Four combatant ships (a Grisha corvette, a Polnocny small landing ship, a Yevgenya minesweeper, and a Matka ex-missile boat) and 31 various auxiliary vessels were returned to Ukraine by June 2014 at the latest; at least 9 vessels were not returned, but scrapped. All vessels returned were in service at their time of capture; all but one of the vessels (U926) confirmed to have been scrapped were decommissioned at their time of capture.
