Avogadrite ((K,Cs)BF4) is a potassium-caesium tetrafluoroborate in the halide class. Avogadrite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (space group Pnma) with cell parameters a 8.66 Å, b 5.48 Å and c Å 7.03.


== History ==
The mineral was discovered by the Italian mineralogist Ferruccio Zambonini
in 1926. He analyzed several samples from the volcanic fumaroles close to Mount Vesuvius and from the Lipari islands. In nature, it can only be found as a sublimation product around volcanic fumaroles.  He named it after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856).
