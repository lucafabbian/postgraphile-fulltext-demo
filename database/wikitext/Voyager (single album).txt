== Composition ==
Voyager literally means "traveler" in English. It is an album that tells the story of Kihyun, who went on a trip to a new world, from a "traveler's point of view"."Voyager" is a pop number genre with strong addictive bass and guitar sounds, that emphasizes his cool vocals, along with the rocking band sound that soothes the weary mind. It is also an exciting, high-energy song, about adventuring into the paradise he has always dreamed of, where the lyrics are about going off the grid and seeing the world, but they also reflect his personal experiences venturing into solo music. ", (Comma)" takes a slightly softer tone, using the lyrics to drive home a more personal message about constantly trying to appear like he is okay, with the pressure to perform at high levels, regardless of the mental and emotional toll, is something we all experience in the modern world. "Rain" takes on a darker, more mysterious sound than the previous two songs, describing the emotional aftermath of a painful breakup.

For the three tracks, Kathleen Nolan of American Songwriter wrote "while 'Voyager' sets the tone of a thrilling new adventure for Kihyun, ', (Comma)' and 'Rain' highlight his emotional side and strong lyrical ability".
