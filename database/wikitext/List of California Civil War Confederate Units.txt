The following is a List of California Civil War Confederate Units that were active between 1861 â€“ 1866. Although California stayed in the Union, it was divided in its politics like many of the Border States. The southern part of the state had the majority of the southern sympathizers.
In 1861, Los Angeles and El Monte formed two secessionist militia units.  Following the Federals success at securing California most of the Southerners who still wished to fight left for the east overland via Mexico, New Mexico Territory or by sea to reach the Confederacy.
