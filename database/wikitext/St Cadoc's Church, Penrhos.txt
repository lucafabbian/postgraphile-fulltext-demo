The church is 15th century in origin, in a Perpendicular style. The church was restored in 1848 and again, under the direction of the architect John Prichard, in 1878. The tower was restored in 1905. By 2016 the church was in a poor state of repair and the nave was inaccessible, due to safety concerns. Restoration works have now been completed, supported by a grant of Â£121,00 from the Heritage Lottery Fund.
