Houston drafted Ann Meyers from the University of California, Los Angeles and Lusia Harris, a collegiate standout at Delta State University. Harris was reluctant to commit to playing after hearing the $3,000 to $5,000 salaries estimated by the Minnesota franchise and decided to sit out the 1978-79 season and retain her administrative position at Delta State.The team had an all-male cheerleading squad called the Guardian Angels, which team owner Hugh Sweeney promised wouldn't be a "sex show - this is high class".Houston finished the 1978-79 regular season with a league-best record of 26 wins and 8 losses, taking first place in the eastern Division.
