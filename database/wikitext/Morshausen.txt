=== Coat of arms ===
The German blazon reads: Über einem Schildfuß, darin ein goldener Stutzwecken, in silbernem Feld ein schwarzer, linksgewendeter Schwengelbrunnen.
The municipality's arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a well boom with pail to sinister sable, on a base vert a Stutzweck Or.
The well, which stands as the main charge, was endowed in the 15th century by a Hungarian countess who was married at the Ehrenburg (castle). In remembrance of her homeland, the well was built in the style of those typically seen in the Puszta region. The woodwork has been renewed at regular intervals by the municipality ever since, and the well may still be seen on Brunnenstraße (“Well Street”). The Stutzweck is a traditional baked article, and in Morshausen, it stems from a citizen's bequest in 1782. He bequeathed his belongings to the municipality on the proviso that a good field be acquired, and that the rent drawn therefrom be used to bake Stutzwecken during Holy Week and to buy wine. On Maundy Thursday, all the village's poor, wretched and children were to come together in the church to pray for his poor soul and to eat the Stutzwecken dipped in the wine in observance of the Lord's Supper. The Stutzweck is still shared out to the churchgoers each year on Good Friday after midday devotions.
