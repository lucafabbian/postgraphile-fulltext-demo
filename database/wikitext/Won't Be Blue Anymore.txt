The album featured some of Seals most popular songs, including "Bop" and "Meet Me in Montana", a duet with Marie Osmond. These and the third single, "Everything That Glitters (Is Not Gold)", all reached No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart. "Bop" was a major crossover hit, peaking at No. 10 on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. The compact disc format of this album was released on the album's initial release.
