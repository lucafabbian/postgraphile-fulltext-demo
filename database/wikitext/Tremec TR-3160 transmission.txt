The TREMEC TR-3160 is a six-speed RWD manual transmission that features six forward speeds and one reverse speed.  It is manufactured by TREMEC (formerly Transmission Technologies Corporation).
The TR-3160 is designed for either a single or double overdrive application and is used for light delivery vans, light commercial vehicles, or performance vehicle applications.
Based on an 81mm center distance, the TR-3160 utilizes high strength steel on all gears and shafts - maximizing torque capacity and durability while minimizing weight and package size. High capacity tapered bearings and high capacity synchronizers contribute to low shift efforts and shifter travel. All gears are hard-finished.
The multi-rail shift system accommodates direct mount and semi-remote shifter locations that provide greater flexibility while reducing noise, vibration and harshness (NVH).
