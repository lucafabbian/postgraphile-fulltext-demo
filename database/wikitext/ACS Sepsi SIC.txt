== History ==
At the beginning of the 2012-2013 season, the objective of the club was to bring the fans back to the arena, in order to forget the chaotic precedent season. The objective was to qualify for the championships' playoffs. This was realised, Sepsi SIC played in the playoffs but was eliminated by CSU Alba Iulia. The club also took part in the Final Four of the Romanian Cup in  Alba Iulia. Finally, Sepsi SIC ended the season at the fifth place. No club decided to register to the 2013-14 EuroCup, therefore Sepsi SIC, whose financial situation was solid, was given a vacant Romanian place.
