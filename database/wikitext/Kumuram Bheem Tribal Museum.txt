Kumuram Bheem Tribal Museum is a museum at Jodeghat village of Kerameri mandal at Komaram bheem Asifabad district. The Jodeghat Museum, also known as the Asifabad Museum, is one of the most important cultural sites in the Asifabad and adjacent areas.The museum stands out as one of the most historically significant locations in terms of Asifabad's tribal culture and Heritage. On September 1, 1940, Adivasi fighter Kumuram Bheem and his companions were martyred at Jodeghat, and the location developed a reputation for bravery and courage.
Kumuram Bheem, the popular tribal revolutionary, fought for Adivasi rights and was known for his thoughts on Jal (water), Jungle (forest) and  Zameen (land).


== History ==
The museum was launched on October 16, 2016, by Chief Minister Kalvakuntla Chandra Shekhar Rao, in honour of tribal chiefs who bravely fought for Jal (water), Jungle (forest), and Zameen (land).Kumuram Bheem was a tribal leader who rose up against Nizam police brutality in order to protect Adivasi rights and forest areas. Because the steep location has good defence facilities, Bheem has picked Jodeghat as the focal point for combating police forces. Tribal people were disturbed by Bheem's quest for sovereignty over Jal, the jungle, and Zameen. The news quickly travelled to 12 newly constructed hamlets in Asifabad district's Kerameri Mandal. He used guerrilla warfare method for fighting against the Nizams.
On September 10, 1940, Bheem held his last meet at Avval pen of Jodeghat, and Nizam's men assaulted him. Kumuram Bheem and several of his followers were murdered in the fight.
