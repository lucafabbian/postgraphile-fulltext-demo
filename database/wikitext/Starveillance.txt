== Response ==
The response from critics was mostly positive. For example, Variety said:
"Starveillance isn't the kind of concept likely to have significant staying power, but it feels like a logical step for E! as the channel seeks to branch out beyond its limited reality-TV profile into somewhat more ambitious fare -- the kind of show whose best moments are tailor-made to be sliced, diced and repurposed on YouTube." - Brian Lowry, Variety.


== Syndication and Broadcast ==
Teen channel The N aired the episodes from April 11, 2009, to May 16, 2009. In addition to airing in the United States, the series aired in Italy under the title Starveglianza on E! in the same year.


== Awards ==
In 2008, the series was nominated an Elan Award for Best Animated Production.
