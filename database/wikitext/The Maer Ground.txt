In 1951, the Maer hosted Devon's first Minor Counties Championship match against Berkshire, and has since played host to 49 Minor Counties Championship matches. The ground played host to a Women's One Day International between England and New Zealand in the 1973 Women's World Cup.

The Maer has hosted 16 List A matches, the last of which came in the 2005 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy when Devon hosted Essex. In 2004 the ground played host to one of the biggest upsets in county cricket history when Devon defeated Leicestershire by losing fewer wickets in tying with Leicestershire's score of 156.  In 2008, the ground played host to the touring Kenya, who defeated Devon by ten runs in a one-day match.
