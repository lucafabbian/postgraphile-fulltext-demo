Pasvik (also known as Paatsjoki in Finnish and Kven languages) is a village in Northern Norway adjacent to the Norway-Russia border. In spite of its very high latitude Pasvik holds the Norwegian record for the warmest summer night with a low of 25.7 °C (78.3 °F) from 17 July 1957. Most of the time, its subarctic climate is very cold.
