== Reception ==
AllMusic wrote: "Despite their fundamental vision, further listens will show Evolution Fight to be a deceptively intricate album (check the wonky piano loop that backs the ribbon-blown lyrics on the title track or the off-beat rhythm that backs a gospel sample on 'Up Above'), and that might make it more worthy of the City Centre tag of musical advancement than many more overtly abstract hip-hop albums." Stylus Magazine wrote: "Polemical without becoming condescending, superbly judged without seeming contrived, but most significantly a great listen that bounces you about, knocks you down, engages your head and has you belly dancing with glee, Evolution Flight is easily one of the yearâ€™s best releases." CMJ New Music Monthly called the album "consistently enjoyable and party-friendly."
