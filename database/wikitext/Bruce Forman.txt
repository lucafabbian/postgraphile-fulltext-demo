Bruce Forman (born 1956) is an American jazz guitarist.
Forman took piano lessons at an early age before picking up the guitar at age thirteen. In 1971, his family moved to San Francisco, where he led his own groups in the area and performed with local jazz musicians, such as Eddie Duran, Vince Lateano, and Eddie Marshall, and with nationally known musicians, such as Ray Brown, George Cables, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, and Woody Shaw. He also performed regularly at the Monterey Jazz Festival. He played with Richie Cole from 1978 to 1982. His most successful album as a leader was 1992's Forman on the Job, which hit #14 on the U.S. Billboard Top Jazz Albums chart. Forman has appeared on several film scores composed by Clint Eastwood, including Million Dollar Baby.
