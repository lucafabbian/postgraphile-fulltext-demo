== Recreation ==

== Development criticism ==
Residents of Thornhill Park have criticized developers Wel.Co and the Victorian State Government for failing to provide adequate transport connections to the suburb. Masterplan images released by Wel.Co advertised a railway station located in the center of the suburb and an overpass on Mount Cottrell Rd allowing traffic to travel in both directions on the Western Highway. Neither the train station nor the overpass have been built forcing residents to make a detour to the next highway overpass at Ferris Rd to access shops, schools, and the Melbourne Central Business District.
