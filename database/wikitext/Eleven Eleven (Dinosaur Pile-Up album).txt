== Critical reception ==
The album has received mostly moderate to favourable reviews. Rod Yates of Rolling Stone Australia stated "the likes of 'Friend Of Mine' and 'Willow Tree' are like sonic shots of adrenaline, 'Anxiety Trip' is as sludgy as molasses, while 'Crystalline' proves the trio know their way around a good chorus. Textured closer 'Cross My Heart' suggests the band are capable of broadening their sonic palette."
