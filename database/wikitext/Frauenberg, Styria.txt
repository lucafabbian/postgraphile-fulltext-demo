== History ==
In 1354 a chapel was built on a site then occupied by a statue of the Virgin Mary.   The chapel was replaced in 1489 by a church in the late Gothic style, and this in turn was replaced by a Baroque church in 1769.   Here, in 1775, the famous organ builder Anton Römer installed an organ.
