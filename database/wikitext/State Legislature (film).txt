State Legislature is a 2007 American documentary film directed by Frederick Wiseman. It details the workings of the Idaho Legislature. Wiseman filmed for a total of 160 hours over a full 12-week session of the legislature, later editing his content down to a 3 Â½ hour film. Wiseman was interested in the topic as a way to show one of the more basic political systems in America at work. It was first broadcast on PBS in June 2007.
