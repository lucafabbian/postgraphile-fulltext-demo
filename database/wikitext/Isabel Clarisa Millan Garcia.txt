Garcia worked as an archaeologist in the 1940s, after the Spanish Civil War. During this time, archaeology was slowly expanding its workforce. It was previously a difficult job to find as a woman, and often involved unpaid work. About 70% of all Spanish museum workers in the 1940s were women. However, this occupation slowly became less favorable, by the 1960s only 20% of Spanish museum workers were women.Garcia never married, which was common for many female archaeologists and other University educated women during the period after the Spanish Civil War.
