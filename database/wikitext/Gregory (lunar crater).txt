Gregory is a lunar impact crater on the far side of the Moon.  It is located to the southeast of the crater Ibn Firnas, and north-northeast of Bečvář. About one crater diameter to the north is the smaller Morozov.
This is a worn and eroded crater formation. The northern rim is degraded due to impacts. Attached to the exterior of the southwest is Gregory Q, a satellite crater about the same size as Gregory. Within the interior is the remains of a small crater rim along the northwestern inner wall. To the east of Gregory and leading away to the southeast is a crater chain designated Catena Gregory.The crater was named after 17th century Scottish astronomer and mathematician James Gregory by the IAU in 1970.  While Gregory itslef was unnumbered, its satellite crater Gregory Q was known as Crater 282 prior to naming in 2006.
