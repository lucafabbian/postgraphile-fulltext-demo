Her only screen role was in Dr. No and it was a matter of chance; the production crew of Dr. No encountered her at Kingston airport as they were preparing for filming. LeWars was an employee there at the time and they decided to use her in the film. She was first offered the role of Miss Taro but she was reluctant because of the sexual theme involved. She was then offered the small role of Annabel Chung. In the commentary of the Dr. No DVD release, LeWars reveals that makeup was applied to her face to make her appear partly Asian. She also states that her voice in the film was dubbed over by the filmmakers without her prior knowledge. LeWars was invited to London to dub but declined. In July 2022 LeWars revealed during a Really 007 Podcast that the real reason for her refusal to dub was that she had been  propositioned by Terence Young. She is also seen in the documentary Inside Dr. No as herself.
