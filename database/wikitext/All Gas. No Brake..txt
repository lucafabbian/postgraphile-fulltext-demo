== Critical reception ==
The album was received to mixed reviews, some affirming it for a good debut, others noting the album was nothing above average.
Kim Jones of Ask.com positively stated: "If you're a pop/punk fan, you'll love Stellar Kart's All Gas. No Brake. If you're not a fan, you should still give it a listen. The high energy, high impact songs are all well done with a lot of skill and a lot of passion....All in all, I'd have to say that Stellar Kart's freshman release is a good one and I expect to see great things out of this young band in the future."John DiBiase of Jesus Freak Hideout went on to say: "With music drawing heavy influences from artists like Relient K and Blink-182, Stellar Kart has the strength to carry the pop/punk torch into the Christian industry, but doesn't entirely add anything new to the genre. That essentially isn't really a problem because Stellar Kart does the style very well...Stellar Kart's All Gas. No Brake. isn't a perfect debut, but it possesses enough momentum to make it worth checking out. Pop-punk fans alike should find plenty to like about Stellar Kart."On the flipside, Nathan of New Release Tuesday frankly said: "The messages are mostly lame, the music while snappy, begins to wear on the listener after a few spins. All Gas. No Brake. is a rough debut which has potential but, the wise buyer will skip the CD."
