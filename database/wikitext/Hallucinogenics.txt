Wongo Okon of Uproxx gave a positive review of the remix, stating "the duo's vocals roar as they send proclamations of 'tripping on hallucinogenics' into the skies. Pushed by the breezy strings of a guitar on the track's production, the duo close out the track and bring it to a smooth and comforting end." Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone wrote "Del Rey slips easily into the song, which begins as a soft acoustic folk number before leveling up several notches with the arrival of some big drum hits and atmospheric synth touches", adding that "Del Rey and Maeson split vocal duties throughout the song and come together in harmony on the hook."
