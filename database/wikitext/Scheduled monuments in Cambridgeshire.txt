There are 287 scheduled monuments in the county of Cambridgeshire in the East of England. These protected sites date from the Neolithic period and include barrows, churches, castle earthworks, Roman roads, moated sites and medieval priories.
In the United Kingdom, the scheduling of monuments was first initiated to insure the preservation of "nationally important" archaeological sites or historic buildings. The protection given to scheduled monuments is given under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979
