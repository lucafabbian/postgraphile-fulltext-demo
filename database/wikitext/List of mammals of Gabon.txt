This is a list of the mammal species recorded in Gabon. Of the mammal species in Gabon, four are endangered, nine are vulnerable, and seven are near threatened.The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature:

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of near threatened and least concern categories:
