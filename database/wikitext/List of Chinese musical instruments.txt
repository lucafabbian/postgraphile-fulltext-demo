Chinese musical instruments are traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bā yīn (八音). The eight categories are silk, bamboo, wood, stone, metal, clay, gourd and skin; other instruments considered traditional exist that may not fit these groups. The grouping of instruments in material categories in China is one of the first musical groupings ever devised.


== Silk (絲) ==
Silk (絲) instruments are mostly stringed instruments (including those that are plucked, bowed, and struck). Since ancient times, the Chinese have used twisted silk for strings, though today metal or nylon are more frequently used. Instruments in the silk category include:


=== Plucked ===


=== Bowed ===


=== Struck ===


=== Combined ===
Wenqin (文琴) – a combination of the erhu, konghou, sanxian and guzheng with 50 or more steel strings.
Qingzhou cuoqin (青州挫琴) – strucked and bowed zither from Shandong, China.


== Bamboo (竹) ==

Bamboo (竹) mainly refers to woodwind instruments, which includes;


=== Flutes ===


=== Free reed pipes ===


=== Single reed pipes ===


=== Double reed pipes ===


== Wood (木) ==

Most wood (木) instruments are percussion instruments of the ancient variety:

== Stone ==
The stone (石) category comprises various forms of stone chimes.


== Metal (金) ==


== Clay (土) ==


== Gourd (匏) ==


== Hide-skin (革) ==


== Others ==


== Ethnic instruments ==


== Playing contexts ==
Chinese instruments are either played solo, collectively in large orchestras (as in the former imperial court) or in smaller ensembles (in teahouses or public gatherings). Normally, there is no conductor in traditional Chinese music, nor any use of musical scores or tablature in performance. Music was generally learned aurally and memorized by the musician(s) beforehand, then played without aid. As of the 20th century, musical scores have become more common, as has the use of conductors in larger orchestral-type ensembles.
