The Last of the Mohicans (German: Der letzte der Mohikaner) is the feature-length second part of the 1920 German silent Western film Lederstrumpf (Leatherstocking) directed by Arthur Wellin and featuring Bela Lugosi and Emil Mamalock. It is based on James Fenimore Cooper's 1826 novel of the same name. The first part is The Deerslayer and Chingachgook (Der Wildtöter und Chingachgook). A print of Lederstrumpf, in its heavily edited shortened U.S. version titled The Deerslayer, was discovered in the 1990s, but the original full-length German film is lost. Bela Lugosi played the Indian Chingachgook, one of his most unusual roles, and Emil Mamalock played Hawkeye, the Deerslayer.
