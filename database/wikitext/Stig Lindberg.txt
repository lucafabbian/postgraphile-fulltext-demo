Stig Lindberg (17 August 1916 in Umeå, Sweden – 7 April 1982 in San Felice Circeo, Italy) was a Swedish ceramic designer, glass designer, textile designer, industrial designer, painter, and illustrator.
One of Sweden's most important postwar designers, Lindberg created whimsical studio ceramics and graceful tableware lines during a long career with the Gustavsberg pottery factory. Stig Lindberg studied painting at the University College of Arts, Crafts and Design. In 1937, he went to work at Gustavsberg under Wilhelm Kåge. In 1949, he was named Kåge's successor as art director. From this period until he left Gustavsberg in 1980, he designed individual ceramic items, as well as factory produced ranges and lines of dinnerware. He achieved fame for his eccentric forms and whimsical decoration. He died from a myocardial infarction in 1982.
His work was featured at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm from 11 May 2006 to 25 February 2007.
