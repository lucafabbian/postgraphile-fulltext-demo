== History ==

Duquette is located along the BNSF Railway on what was at one time the Great Northern Railway.  It was built on an early native American village site located at the southern terminus of the Willow–Nemadji Portage; the first European settlers were French Canadians, among them was the entrepreneur Frank Duquette, who built a sawmill and store.  Originally the village was named Kerrick until the Great Northern Railway depot was moved three miles south, keeping that name, and for a period Duquette was called Old Kerrick, the new site being called New Kerrick; the names were corrected when the Duquette post office was established in 1905.
