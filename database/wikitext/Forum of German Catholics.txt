The Forum of German Catholics (German: Forum Deutscher Katholiken) is a conservative Catholic lay organization in Germany. It was founded in 2000 in opposition to the Central Committee of German Catholics. 


== History and function ==
The Forum of German Catholics was founded on 30 September 2000 in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Fulda and is based in Kaufering, Bavaria. It is an official religious organization registered with the German government. It was founded by Hubert Gienten, with the guidance of Archbishop Johannes Dyba. A conservative organization, it was formed in opposition to the Central Committee of German Catholics.The forum, made up of members of the Catholic laity, claims to be committed to "unadulterated and unabridged" faith. It hosts congresses and other events, focused on Catholic teaching and ministry. Since 2001, the forum hosts the annual Congress on Joy of Faith, taking place in Fulda and Regensburg. In 2002 the congress was officiated by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger. In 2009, the forum released a resolution stating that Muslims were natural allies in the "fight against a culture of death". The resolution also stated that the "systematic displacement of the Christian faith from politics and public life" was the most dangerous threat in Europe. Participants of the 2009 conference included Archbishop Jean-Claude Perisset, Bishop Gregor Maria Hanke, Bishop Friedhelm Hofmann, and Bishop Karl-Heinz Wiesemann. In 2014 the congress's opening ceremony was officiated by Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig MÃ¼ller.


== Controversies ==
In 2007 Eva Herman, who has been accused of promoting ideas from the Third Reich, served as a guest speaker at the forum's seventh annual congress. Her involvement was criticized by Dieter Graumann, Vice President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany. Herman's involvement was also protested by Alois Rhiel, the Minister of Economics in Hesse, who resigned from his patronage of the congress.In 2019 the forum called for Catholic women to boycott the Catholic German Women's Association, after the organization had shown support for the Mary 2.0 movement.
