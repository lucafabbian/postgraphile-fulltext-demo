== Biography ==
Born in Cruzy (Hérault), her family settled in Rouen,  and she enrolled at the École supérieure d'art et design Le Havre-Rouen to attend courses in painting, sculpture and drawing, but by chance Reynaldo Hahn heard her as she sang in a church. The composer advised her to take singing lessons. Couderc enrolled at the Conservatoire de Rouen in tenor Henri Saint-Cricq's class. After obtaining her prizes, she joined the Conservatoire de Paris in Suzanne Cesbron-Viseur's class.
She first joined the chorus of the Paris Opera, where she was also given a few small roles as in Fauré's Pénélope. She left the Paris Opera and began a solo career in her own right. During the 1944-1945 season she sang  Werther  (Charlotte), with José Luccioni and Margared in Le Roi d'Ys beside her former Professor Saint-Cricq at the Nice Opera. In French theatres she achieved success as  Dalila, Orpheus, Azucena (Il trovatore), Léonore (La Favorite), Vénus (Lohengrin), etc.
Often compared to the Italian mezzo Ebe Stignani for the range of her voice (from do² to counter-D), she performed all over the world: at Teatro Colón of Buenos Aires, in Belgium, Athens, Algiers and Oran, Switzerland, Copenhagen, etc.
Retired from the stage in 1976, she devoted herself to teaching. She was married to critic and writer Stéphane Wolff.
Couderc died in Toulon 16 November 2005.
