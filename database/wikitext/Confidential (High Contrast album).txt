High Contrast Confidential is the fourth album and the second double album from the Welsh drum and bass producer High Contrast, released on 27 April 2009 on the Hospital Records label. It is an assortment of handpicked songs he has written in the past. The first disc includes a premium selection of singles from his previous three albums but the second disc includes some of his remixes from the past.
The Album Art contains aspects of High Contrast's previous albums. The backdrop is the same as True Colours, he has the suit and cocktail from High Society and the phone pictured on the cover of Tough Guys Don't Dance is lying on the floor.
