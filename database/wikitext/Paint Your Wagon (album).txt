Paint Your Wagon is the second studio album by British rock band Red Lorry Yellow Lorry, and was released in 1986 in the UK on the independent label Red Rhino. It was the band's final original LP release on the label (outside of a singles collection,  Smashed Hits, the following year) before signing to major label Situation Two in 1987. Like their first album Talk About the Weather, Paint Your Wagon had a very short running time at under 30 minutes. Two of the tracks, "Mescal Dance" and "Blitz", were instrumentals. Initial copies came with a limited edition seven-inch single with the tracks "Paint Your Wagon" and "More Jipp".  Cassette and CD releases/reissues have featured various additional bonus tracks.
