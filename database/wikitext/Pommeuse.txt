== History ==
The word "Pommeuse" signifies bridge over the Morin.  The commune was previously named Eboriac and was at the junction of two Roman highways.
The Pommeuse fief was created in 1144.  There were four successive castles or manors.  The first dates back to the 11th century, and allowed the lord to perceive a tax from the people wanting to cross the Morin.  This castle was located on a mound overlooking the feodal land.
The second castle was surrounded by a mote fed by the Morin, and was severely damaged during the Hundred Years' War.
The third castle build around 1480 was based upon a Renaissance type model.  It was destroyed during the revolution and its occupants (the De Langlois family) guillotined.
The fourth castle still inhabited to this day, was built from 1825 to 1830.  It was upon recently still occupied by the De Langlois family.

The population has doubled in 30 years, as it did in a large part of the east of the Paris area.

The commune is host to a twelfth-century church, and a more recent chapel.  Pommeuse and the neighbouring village of Faremoutiers are united in one parish, itself part of the diocese of Meaux.
The abbot Jean Perrin (born 1912) has been the parish priest for 50 years.  Mass has however only very rarely been celebrated in Pommeuse in the past few years because of the age of the priest.
