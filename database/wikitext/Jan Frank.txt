Jan Frank is an American artist-curator based in Manhattan.


== Early life and education ==
Frank was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and grew up in various places around the world, including the Congo and later the American mid-west. His father was a sea captain who ran KLM Cargo.  He attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the early 1970s.  He studied ceramics under potter Don Reitz. Frank completed an Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum, where he worked with founder Ron Clark with whom he collaborated on several films of the period.


== Career ==

Frank moved to downtown New York in 1975 and has lived there in the same loft ever since.  As an art student his first works were large scale Photo Realist paintings. By the time of his first exhibitions in New York he was creating installations of video-sculpture. In the 1990s Frank developed 'Xerox' drawings and plywood  'appropriation' paintings, influenced by artists De Kooning, Phillip Guston, and Louise Bourgeois. This was followed by a series of works based on abstracted motifs drawn from Nixon and Kissinger, the latter politician being photographed by Steve Pyke.

Since 2000 Frank has concentrated on creating abstract drawings and large-scale paintings, based on or extrapolated from the nude female form. Frank worked with John Chamberlain to create a large suite of drawings, which were exhibited, along with sculpture by Chamberlain, at Nahmad Contemporary in New York in the summer of 2014. Most recently, Glenn O'Brien curated a painting show of Frank's at Nahmad Contemporary featuring work from the past 25 years.
