The 2013–14 figure skating season began on July 1, 2013, and ended on June 30, 2014. During this season, elite skaters competed at the Olympic level in the 2014 Winter Olympics and at the ISU Championship level in the 2014 European, Four Continents, World Junior, and World Championships. They also competed in elite events such as the Grand Prix series and Junior Grand Prix series, culminating in the Grand Prix Final.


== Season notes ==


=== Age eligibility ===
Skaters competing at the junior level were required to be at least 13 years old, but not yet 19 (or 21 for male pair skaters and ice dancers), before July 1, 2013. Those who turned 14 before the given date were eligible for the senior Grand Prix series and senior B internationals; those who turned 15 before that date were also eligible for the Olympics, senior World, European, and Four Continents Championships.


=== Minimum scores ===


==== Grand Prix ====
In order to compete in the Grand Prix series, skaters are required to reach a minimum total score at an accepted ISU event.


==== ISU Championships ====
To be eligible to compete at the European, Four Continents, Junior World, or World Championships, skaters are required to achieve the following scores in a prior ISU-recognized event.


=== Partnership changes ===
Some skaters announced the dissolution of a partnership or formation of a new one. Listed are changes involving at least one partner who competed at Worlds, Europeans, Four Continents, Junior Worlds or the senior Grand Prix, or who medaled on the Junior Grand Prix circuit. The ISU does not permit teams to compete for two countries—if skaters of different nationalities team up, they must choose one country to represent.
