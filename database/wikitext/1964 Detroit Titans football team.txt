== Discontinuance of football program ==
On November 30, nine days after the season ended with a road loss at Boston College, the university announced that the football program was being discontinued. The university's president, the Very Rev. Laurence V. Britt, SJ, noted that the football program had not made a profit since 1951, had operated at a deficit for years, and had lost $65,000 in 1964 – a figure critics said was a bookkeeping device attempting to estimate the loss of tuition from players receiving football scholarships. With limited resources and mounting academic costs, Father Britt stated that the university could not subsidize the program at the level demanded by alumni and students. The decision stunned players and angered alumni. A protest by students included the removal of the stadium's goalposts.
