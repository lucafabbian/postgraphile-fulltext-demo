Roudnice is a municipality and village in Hradec Králové District in the Hradec Králové Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 700 inhabitants.


== Etymology ==
The name is derived from the red shades of color (in Czech rudá) of the water in the eponymous local brook, caused by the ore subsoil.


== Geography ==
Roudnice is located about 12 kilometres (7 mi) west of Hradec Králové. It lies in a flat agricultural landscape of the East Elbe Table. There are several lakes created by flooding sand-gravel quarries. The Roudnický brook flows through the municipality.


== History ==
The first written mention of Roudnice is from 1384. At the end of the 14th century at the latest, a fortress was built north of the village. In 1513, it was acquired by the Pernštejn family and merged with the Pardubice estate. From 1560 until the abolition of serfdom in 1848, it was a property of the royal chamber.

Roudnice is poor in monuments. The only cultural monuments are two Neoclassical homesteads.
