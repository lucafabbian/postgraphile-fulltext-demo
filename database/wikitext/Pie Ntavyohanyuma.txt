Pie Ntavyohanyuma is a Burundian politician who was head of the National Assembly from 2007 to 2015. He resigned and fled to Brussels, Belgium on June 28, 2015 during the 2015â€“2018 Burundian unrest, citing the unrest and his opposition to president Pierre Nkurunziza's bid for a disputed third term in the 2015 Burundian presidential election. He told France 24 that he "personally advised President Nkurunziza to drop his plan for a third term, but his answer was to threaten me, to humiliate me."
